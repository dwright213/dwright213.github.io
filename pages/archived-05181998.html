<hr/>
<h4>The Bite Begins . . .BUT</h4>
<p>Yes, there will be a salmon season! The first weekend got
blown away. During the next week a few hardy souls braved a snotty sea at
the Farallons not knowing whether the were fishing for salmon with incidental
rockcod catches or the other way around. The last few days though, have
seen from one-fish-to-the-rod to limits at Montara and the Deep Reef. As
of the 18th, the bite picked up again after a week of doldrums. It's a bit
of a ride to the beasties but at least Neptune seems to be appeased and
the monotheists amongst us are no longer doubting the designs of their deity.
The crew that do at the Emeryville Sportfishing Center
wish to state emphatically that fishermen without circle hooks will not
get their lines wet. The DFG has been finding a lot of small very dead,
gut-hooked salmon. The fear is, that if folks continue to use J hooks, the
powers that be will decree "trolling only". Circle hooks save
young fish and their exclusive use will insure mooching this year, and salmon
fishing itself in the future.</p>
<h4>The Source of Salmon Statutes</h4>
<p><img "="" class="img-floated-left image-process-small-floated-image" src="/images/derivatives/small-floated-image/kimgale-salmon52lb.jpg"/>Despite the machinations of a seemingly
Byzantine regulation machine: it appears this year's salmon statutes will
be pretty much the same as last year except that the circle hook will replace
the J hook when mooching with 1 pound or less, which pretty well makes the
circle hook ubiquitous . . . at least on party boats fishing for salmonoids.
The Emeryville Sportfishing Center's owner Craig Stone
and New Salmon Queen owner and skipper Kurt Hochburg are members of the
Pacific Fishing Management Council's Salmon Advisory Sub Panel. Besides
having titles too long to fit on any T-shirt known to man, Craig and Kurt
will have spent March and early April digesting the data given to them by
those curious folk who count, prod and squeeze salmonoids, and then enter
their findings, drippings, etc. into a computer in a most scientific way.
Craig, Kurt and the other panel members then draft options for the coming
salmon season based on the biologist's guidelines which are pretty much
formulated on directives of the Endangered Species Act.
The before mentioned Pacific Fisheries Management Council
is made up of representatives from Washington, Idaho, Oregon and California
including those from commercial, sport and Native American tribal fishing
concerns. This council is responsible for setting salmon seasons and regulations
that will consider the impacts on all those concerned. Still with me? Maybe
you wanna read about how not to jerk your circle hook . . .elsewhere on
this site.
So then, all these PFMC regulations are subject to the
approval of the National Marine Fishery which reports to the US Dept. of
Commerce. The Endangered Species Act pretty much drives the modus operandi
of this NMF outfit which is currently headed by Bill Hogarth, a good guy,
who replaced the despised Hilda 'De-something or other', who garnered the
loathing of damn near every West Coast person involved with any type of
fishing.
The PFMC recommended that circle hooks only be used mooching
for salmon for the entire season. Like last year, there will be a 24"
limit until the first of July when anglers will have to keep their first
two fish regardless of the size. On September seventh, the 24" limit
will be reinstated until the end of the season. This proposed set of regulations
has been floated out for public feedback and then was adopted, despite widespread
insanity and political craziness, during the mid-April meeting of the council
in Portland.
So, now ya know?</p>
<h4>What to do, (and what not to do) with Your Circle Hook</h4>
<p>Other than the fact that El Nino has not dispersed all
the salmon to Oregon or Wake Island, there's one sure thing the early salmon
season on the southside has taught us. Those who stand at the rail jerking
it, ain't  going to get fish other than the occasional sand dab. The word
is, when you're using circle hooks, DON'T SET THE HOOK!
For lo, these many years, the rail regulars fished J hooks
using nary a jerk and watched dingbats from around the world flail away
and still catch salmon. Then, recently due to decree or practicality, we
fished gitz-its and/or fillets where, if you didn't set the hook and set
it quickly, you went home both empty handed and as a candidate for klutzdom.
This is the first year of the circle hook, kiddies. . .
and quite probably, will be the way of salmon fishing for several seasons
to come. This circle hook seems to do a decent job of reducing the kill
rate on throw-back salmon. When the bait is eaten from a circle hook, the
fish is much more likely to be hooked by the jaw rather than by the gut.
Salmon are a wimpy lot . . . some die just from being looked at the wrong
way. By and large though, most will survive a bit of lip rip 'n jaw bend
if handled lightly or not at all.
Advise from those who should know, on the use of the circle
hooks, range from "Use 'em just like you're supposed to use a J hook."
from Captain Kurt of the New Salmon Queen to a stronger admonishment from
Mike Aughney of FishSite on the net: "Don't set the hook like you do
with a J hook. You will miss the fish every time. Most boats, (from South
of Pigeon Point) are reporting that they are missing many of their fish
due to the new circle hook requirement." An update from the crew that
do at the Emeryville Sportfish Center reveals that most folk are seeing
the light on circle hook usage and are missing fewer fish. That is, other
than professional grumps and people with severe brain lesions.
So, let the fish eat the bait and slowly reel down on the
fish. This will let the hook slide into the jaw line. When your pole really
begins to bend, you can play them as usual."
The California Department of Fish and Game says that there
are more than a million salmon swimming around our coast at this writing.
That's almost twice the count of two years ago and 25% more than last year,
which was a year of truly big fish. What does this all mean? The fish are
there. The skippers will find them. It's up to you to catch them. Pay attention
to the advise of the skipper and crew and don't jerk. -Kim Gale</p>
<h4>The Crew That Do</h4>
<p>The salmon season opener in effect heralds a new season
for the Emeryville Sportfishing Center. Much remains the same but there
are some neat changes in the wings. The <em>C-Gull II</em> under the dual
skippership of <em>Jay Yokomizo</em> and first time daddy, <em>Don</em> "would
you do that in your house?" <em>Wong</em>, is sporting new upholstery
and carpets plus a new prop for better get up and go.
Talking about get up 'n go; Captain "slow-boat"
<em>Harry Garabedian</em> now has the fastest boat in the harbor with his
<em>New Seeker</em>, a 50' Delta with the big bow. Harry and Ralph have equipped
their pride and joy with a TV, V.C.R. and a micro-wave oven. Harry is planning
to forgo Mexico next winter to stick around, and along with the aforementioned
Jay and Don, offer combo rockfish and crab trips.
Sportfishing Center owner and chief cat-caresser, Craig
Stone explained the decision to offer crabbing: "we had thought that
the crab thing might be just too boring along with the ride to the Farallons,
but it appears that people will go through damn near anything to get crabs.
So, crabs they'll get, and with as much comfort as we can provide.
Back to the season at hand: <em>Mick Menigoz</em> has been
watching whales and anything else that gets on or above the surface from
the wheel house of the <em>New Superfish</em>. He is anxious to resume his
role as 'harbor fish-ho'. "I'll fish for anything for money" smirks
the affable Captain Mick.
Skipper <em>Jack Collier</em> has readied his <em>Rapid Transit</em>
for opening day and is ready to mooch while <em>Chris Smith</em> aboard the
<em>Captain Hook</em> is getting ready for his bay forays. Chris may fish
beyond the gate later in the season but with halibut being caught in mid-march,
he's just waiting for live bait on April 19.
Fishing cheerleader and <em>New Huck Finn</em> Captain <em>Art
Roby</em> will start the season putting salmon in the box, but will be targeting
halibut, bass and rockfish now as live bait has become available.
Far to the right, <em>Kurt Hochburg</em> is readying the
<em>New Salmon Queen</em> for the opener after a tough, but overall successful
crab season. Kurt said he had no idea what the El Nino thing will do to
salmon fishing this year. "I just want to go fishin!" </p>
<h4>GOOD EATS</h4>
<p><strong>Wild Wahoo Stew</strong></p>
<p>By far the most difficult aspect of cooking a perfect wahoo
stew is catching a wahoo. Most folk have never seen this fastest of all
fish that streak from the horse latitudes south . . . then twice around
the boat while your reaching for your reel grip. And of those that have,
most have seen only a fleeting wake and a shredded leader. So unless you've
got money and biceps to burn, get your wahoo steaks from the fortunate angler
just back from Baja, South Texas or Carolina. Now remember, we're talking
wahoo here, not yahoo.
The wahoo is the biggest of all mackerels, up to 150 lbs.
with special attributes: a hinged jaw, (like an anaconda), very large, sharp
teeth, the ability to swim at close to 60 miles per hour and, like most
fish, a rather limited agenda; i.e.: bite! So basically, we have a toothy
torpedo, boasting very firm white flesh, without the oil and pungent taste
of it's little cousins. So what to do with two pounds of frozen wahoo flank?
Well, let me tell you how to make a great wahoo stew.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2 lbs. wahoo, dorado or swordfish. (Halibut can be used, but you need to marinate in lime juice, 2 hrs.)</li>
<li>2 potatoes cut into bite size cubes.</li>
<li>1 large onion, thinly sliced.</li>
<li>1 medium green bell pepper cut into 1" squares.</li>
<li>1 large Anaheim pepper cut into 1/2" squares.</li>
<li>3 stalks of celery cut in 1/2" pieces.</li>
<li>4 medium size tomatoes or 6 romas. (A 16 oz. can of tomatoes will work.)</li>
<li>16 oz. fish stock or chicken broth.</li>
<li>Salt, pepper, basil, oregano and chili powder to taste.</li>
<li>Salsa and/or Tabasco sauce to taste.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Optional:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A dozen clams or mussels in the shell.</li>
<li>1/2 lb. or less of raw medium shrimp.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cut the skin off the beast and about 1/4 inch or so of
the dark meat next to the skin. Cut the remaining white meat into one inch
or one and a half inch cubes, (depending on whether your jaws are hinged
for bigger bites). Bring two cups of water to quick boil in your steamer
and steam the wahoo for ten to twelve minutes. Put steamed wahoo cubes aside
and keep that water . . .frothy stuff 'n all. Briefly sauté the onions,
pepper pieces and celery chunks ' til onion is iridescent.
Add two cups of fish stock, (a 16 oz can of chicken broth
will work fine) to your water and boil your potato, onion, pepper and celery
pieces for five minutes or so in a large pot. In another sauce pan bring
two cups of water to a boil and add tomatoes. Cook for five minutes, remove
tomato skins and dump whole thing in your put and season with salt, pepper,
basil, oregano and chili powder to taste. This stew really works well with
Tabasco sauce or hot salsa. Cook at a very slow boil (or a roil, if you
will), for thirty minutes and it's ready. 
Now then, for an added touch, add a dozen clams or mussels
about fifteen minutes before taking off the stove. To really top it off,
introduce a half pound of cleaned, raw medium size shrimp to the concoction
for the last five minutes. Woof! Be sure to have a bunch of sourdough bread.
This concoction is well complemented by either a light red wine or a chardonay.</p>
<p><strong>Fillet That Salmon!</strong>
Some folks, for reasons of heredity, or a love of spitting
fish bones, will instinctively cut up a salmon into steaks. This is not
say that barbequed or broiled salmon steaks are passé, but by filleting
your fish, you'll get to eat more of it and in an infinitely greater number
of ways. Plus you'll bypass the little bones between your teeth or under
your plate. Filleting a salmon is an easy thing. Cut behind the collar to
the backbone, then along the backbone to the tail. Save the stomach meat
for salmon burger or loaf and don't forget the meat along the backbone that
can be easily shaved off to be lightly fried with scrambled eggs and chives.</p>
<p>Your salmon fillet can be easily boned with small snub-nosed
pliers before being poached, steamed, baked, broiled, grilled or smoked.</p>

<h4>The 1997 Fish Wrap</h4>
<p>Quite a year for fish stories. The best since 1906, when
in early April of that year, hundreds of barracuda inexplicably beached
themselves on San Francisco's Embarcadero near Washington Street causing
widespread fear and loathing. Proper women screamed, improper ones moaned,
horses were bitten about the fetters and strong men repaired to the Barbary
Coast for another morning nip. One local wag was heard to lament, "why
me, Lord? Next It'll probably be a Godamned earthquake!"
Getting back toward reality: at the Emeryville Sportfishing
Center, where soothsayer of all things fishy; Craig Stone, waxed poetic
on the year that was. This writer failed to elicit much commentary on the
first two months of last year when fishing San Pablo Bay and upper San Francisco
Bay was an adventure avoiding Big Valley riff-raff bound for 
<img class="img-floated-left image-process-small-floated-image" src="/images/derivatives/small-floated-image/kimgale-Ssturgn.gif"/>
Guam. The sturgeon folks did pretty well along the Alameda Rock Wall and points South, but
by March, most of the action was that of folks getting ready for the salmon
opener. 
"In March, Fish and Game claimed that there was the
third largest concentration of salmon off our coast in the fifty years of
tallying such data," <img "="" class="img-floated-right image-process-small-floated-image" src="/images/derivatives/small-floated-image/kimgale-salmongoldengate.jpg"/>Craig mused. Opening
day confirmed the high hopes. The fish were as big as one would expect in
July and limits were the rule. It was the start of, "a very good year",
according to Mr. Stone. "Big fish, a fast start, an unbelievable April."</p>
<p>The ocean got real snotty in May so the salmon folks took
up halibut fishing and enjoyed the fruits of a spectacular early butt season.
This writer hooked a big halibut on the Berkeley Pier in late March which
was a sort of a preview of the next couple of months for halibut fishers.
April and May saw a two big fish per rod average on most trips to the Berkeley
flats on South. This unexpected fishy bonus proved serendipitous for Kurt,
Harry and the salmon folk who day after day were turned around by the nastiness
at Point Bonita only to offer their clients a real good day of butt kicking
on the Bay. Craig feels that the three fish limit instituted in '96 may
have really helped last year's halibut season. "It was the best April
and May ever for halibut. The fish were of the size one would expect in
July and August." Halibut showed early and left early. 
"The commercial guys got fat on halibut and while
the sport fishermen abided by lowered limits, a slew of commercial folk
fished the Bay with no limits other than what the market could bear",
Craig went on to say, "and of course, they did absolutely nothing to
protect it's own industry. There is a growing movement to put the Bay off
limits entirely to commercial fishermen while saving it for the sport anglers,
who are the only ones taking the initiatives to save their fishery."
The ocean mellowed in June, and as the halibut fishery
faded, there was good salmon fishing day in and day out through the rest
of the summer. When asked about the results of the different tackle restrictions
and size limits during the '97 season, Craig said that no data has been
released to date, but March meetings of the National Maritime Fishery Board
should provide a lot of insight into the results of the rather Byzantine
array of rules and regulations imposed on salmon sport fisher persons. "We
can be sure of one thing", Craig promised, "the circle hook is
here to stay. It really does the job that it was designed to do, that of
hooking fish by their mouths rather than by their gut." Craig went
on to explain that other threatened fisheries do not need the circle hook
since bass and halibut rarely swallow a hook.
The last couple of months of the salmon season was a bit
scratchy, particularly in late October, but a lot of truly huge fish tasted
the milk of human kindness while barely fitting in the nets that assisted
their passage from sea to fish box. As luck would have it, as the salmon
split to scratch the gravel of their spawning grounds in record numbers,
the rock cod and ling cod went on a major bite that lasted 'til the end
of the year. According to Mr. Stone, '97 was a banner year for rock fish.
"The school fish were bigger than they have been for years and the
limit rate was almost one hundred percent. A few days of bad weather, or
times when the focus was on ling cod, were the only ocassions that we didn't
get full limits."
The ling cod fishery has, however, taken a hit by commercial
trawlers. There were some great days of ling fishing in late October and
early November, but most of the fish were ten pounds or less and generally,
the toothy critters were a bit evasive. This ling cod situation will be
dealt with by new regulations next year. The limit will go from five fish
to three per day and the length limit will increase two inches to 24".
The commercial catch will be quite severely curtailed, (for rock fish as
well as lings), which should give the ling a chance to recover and make
the school fish angling even better. This bodes well for that curious, bizarre
angler who would use light black bass gear with eight pound line and a two
oz. jig to play with their fish. Yet another regulation will limit three
bacaccio to the bag next year. This will not mean a great deal to those
fishing the Farallons, but will definitely cut down on the size of gunny
sacks for the folks who fish out of Bodega Bay. 
Striped Bass were not targeted often by the Crew That Do
from the Emeryville Sportfishing Center, but a lot were caught incidentally
while fishing for halibut. The bass seemed to have forgotten a 
<img class="img-floated-left image-process-small-floated-image" src="/images/derivatives/small-floated-image/kimgale-stripper.gif"/>
lot of their traditional itinerary milestones and are
now widely dispersed through the bay systems much of the year. There was
a brief flurry of striped bass at the towers and the Pacifica beaches but
not as pronounced a run as in years past. Chris Smith of the Captain Hook
limited day after day for a while in September before moving to San Rafael
for the winter. "The striper fishery is improving", promises Craig,
"some years there's just so much going on that we don't specifically
target the linesiders."</p>
<p>Then there was the tuna thing . . ."We
may never see another fishing event like this in Northern California",
this from a behind-the-counter cynic who is not given to superlatives except
those directed toward his cats. There were reports of albacore within forty
miles of the coast in late July. The party boats out of Santa Cruz and Half
Moon Bay began getting decent counts, (actually the best counts in years)
in mid August. Then the dam broke. On August 22nd, the Superfish with Mick
Menigoz at the helm, pulled in 190 albacore for 16 anglers. This was an
astounding catch and remained that, even though the Sailfish from Sausalito
nailed 212 and Half Moon Bay's Wild Wave gaffed a seemingly impossible 435
fish that day. The fishing stayed hot for weeks as the weather allowed.
The catches were much smaller in number but the fish got bigger and bigger.
60 lbs., 70 lbs and then unheard of beasts, weighing 80 pounds and more.
A world record albacore weighing more than ninety pounds was the capper.
Blue fin tuna were being caught regularly plus a few dorado, and marlin.
No piranha. At his writing, at the first of the new year, they are still
getting monster albacore on a regular basis off Santa Cruz. Jeez, who would
have thought?

<p>Late October or early November, in years past, saw a small, curious group
of the good, the bad and the ugly from the Emeryville Sportfishing Center
peregrinate to work their magic on or near the waters of San Jose de Cabo
in Baja California Sur, Mexico. One year Don Wong caught and released most
of the resident marlin community. Another year saw tripmaster Craig Stone
mistakenly busted as the kingpin of all kingpins during a midnight chip
shot practice soiree on some 'malecon' or 'nother.</p>
<p>This year was different. Less weird, you might venture? Oh no . . . just
a lot more folks, a lot more fishy stories and then, Halloween to boot.</p>
<p>Twenty-six people boarded the non-stop flight from SFO at eleven o'clock
on a Saturday morning, bound for eight days and seven nights in San Jose
Del Cabo, a modest burg, 'bout twenty miles East of the glitziness that
is Cabo San Lucas. The one airport that serves this part of the world is
in San Jose Del Cabo, thus insuring the troop a short mid-afternoon ride
to the very spiffy Tropicana Inn, a stone's throw from the waters of confluence
between The Pacific and the Sea of Cortez.</p>
<p>Two folks came to shop and loll. The other twenty-four assembled on the
beach dark 'n early the next morning to assemble as twelve pre-ordained
teams, each in a super panga, with canvas cover and center cockpit, from
the vaunted Victor's Fleet. The boats loaded up on live bait, the pangeros
cutting a dashing silhouette, casting their nets in the dawn. Eleven boatloads
ventured west toward San Lucas, where within an hour, they began a morning-long
orgy of fighting modest sized dorado and yellowfin tuna. One boat, it's
pangarooni undoubtedly bribed by the invariably intuitive Frank Salazar,
went North to a spot near the Gordo Bank where Mr. Salazar caught the first
day's jackpot, a thirty-one pound yellowfin.</p>
<p>Monday morning was more of the same except that Sunday's light winds
died and the one boat that headed North carried two of the six women fisher
folk; Beth Smith and Cathy Fletcher. Beth hooked into the largest dorado
she had ever seen, (and she has seen a lot of 'em). Beth's dodo did the
tail walk, this walk and that walk, then walked (or swam), away. All aboard
agreed that it was at least a fifty pounder. On the western front, Craig
Stone, (keeper of lame animals) took a step toward lameness, himself, struggling
to land Monday's top fish, a yellowfin that weighed in at twenty-eight pounds.
However, the ubiquitous Frank Salazar pre-empted "struggle sagas"
by wrestling for well over a half hour with a ninety pound recalcitrant
sailfish. Sorry Frank, sailfish, marlin 'n orcas don't count for jackpot
money. Again the fishing was excellent. Lots of quality tuna and dorado
were dredged up, plus a boodle of bonito, which were released along with
yellow fin footballs.</p>
<p>Tuesday was a day off from the rigors and angst of angling. One contingent
went snorkeling while most folks poked around their ever-so-quaint environs.
Craig Stone found a stray cat that would retrieve his wedge shots from one
part the beach to another part of the beach, snoozing German tourists notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Wednesday's rosy fingered dawn triggered the advent of a new force in
the world of big fish bragging rights, that of Mike Mahoney, the svelte,
mild mannered dock czar of the city of Emeryville. Against all odds, our
Mr. Mahoney proved, in a manner of speaking, that lightning can indeed strike
the same spot twice. Wednesday morning the fleet motored toward Cabo San
Lucas where under the bright blue sky, the sea of glass began giving up
her fruits of yellowfin and dorado in bunches. Virtually no trolling here,
folks. Just fly line an anchovy with a half ounce rubber core 'n gird 'yer
loins. The above lauded, Mike Mahoney caught the day's jackpot, a thirty-four
pound dorado.</p>
<p>Thursday was more of the same. Everyone caught both tuna and dorado and
the jackpot fish was again garnered by "Iron Mike", this time
a forty-nine pound yellowfin that tested the good harbormaster's resolve
in a fifty minute marathon. As the day before, there were countless hookups
and subsequent release of bonita.</p>
<p>Friday was a day to rest weary arms 'n torso and to prepare for a night
of Halloween frivolity. A group of eight motored up to Hank Schram's Baja
digs for a cocktail or two and were set upon by Chris Schram, makeup artist
extraodinaire. While most of the folks were made to look positively goulish,
Don Wong was reincarnated as a trollop that might well straighten the wattles
of old turkeys to Plymouth Rock and back. The costume party then moved West
to Cabo and danced the night away at Kokomo's, a trendy new nightery. Meanwhile,
another intrepid group of revelers from the Emeryville ranks congregated
at the Giggling Marlin, where one could be, and several were, strung up
by the ankles and fed tequila laced jello. That was early in the evening.
The real fun came later.</p>
<p>Saturday morning and all of God's little wanderers from the night of
the dead were herded on to the bus at 11 o'clock for a quick jaunt to the
airport and a non-stop flight, and late afternoon landing in San Francisco.
Reflecting for a moment, on the seemingly better than usual fishing on this
excursion, Craig said that while some wags attributed the good angling to
El Nino, many knowledgeable folks felt that the weather phenomenon was just
incidental. "We were where there were a lot of hungry fish." People
who know where the fish are, and enthusiastic fisher folk mean a lot of
caught fish, year after year.</p>
<p>Talk to Craig, or any of the crew that do at the Emeryville Sportfishing
Center, about next year!</p>

<h4>Daaaady! Where do lingcod come from?</h4>
<p>Good question, princess." Daddy don't know the difference between
a lingcod and a harpsicod, so dauntless daughter checks the net, the web,
the thingee, and lo and behold, she alights at http://www.psmfc.org/~wvanbusk/,
otherwise configured as Fish Bulletin 176. Once there, she'll find, under
"Lingcod"</p>
<p>"In California, lingcod egg masses are deposited from November to
early March in rocky habitats (Miller and Geibel 1973). Lingcod egg masses
have been observed to depths of 97 m (O'Connell 1993). Water current flow
is necessary for gas exchange and prevention of high mortality within the
egg mass (Giorgi and Congleton 1984), and nests are typically located in
areas of water movement. Male lingcod guard the egg mass from predators
during incubation (Hart 1973). Removal of the male causes a high incidence
of egg loss to predators (Low and Beamish 1978). Incubation takes about
seven weeks in the Puget Sound area, and is probably briefer in California
(Miller and Geibel 1973). Newly hatched larvae are 7-10 mm in length (Hart
1973).</p>
<p>After hatching, young lingcod are pelagic until they are about 70 mm
long. Larvae and juveniles have been commonly found in the upper 30 m of
the water column in the Gulf of the Farallones, with density decreasing
with distance from shore."</p>
<p>Now then, this is good stuff if you're a marine biologist or a glutton
for dense reading. There's about 25,000 words on lingcod and rock fish in
these DFG bulletins. Herewith, this writer offers a translation that touches
on the how's, where's and whatzit's on lingcod.</p>
<p>It seems that missus lingcod makes her longest trip of the year sometime
between September and November for a brief fling in the rocks with a much
smaller male. Once she has relieved herself of her large egg mass and sees
to it that they are well spermed by the male in a most likely, loveless
ritual, the lovelorn lady lingster returns to her deeper, less turbulent
lair, leaving Mr. Ling to guard the spawning nest.</p>
<p>They have mated in a relatively shallow location allowing the currents
and tidal surge to cause gas exchanges within the egg mass. This movement
within the egg mass ensures a high survival rate. The male at this point
has a six or seven week watch until the eggs hatch. The survival of the
incubating eggs is dependent on the good guardianship of daddy ling. If
he can restrain himself from chomping a lure or an anchovy with a hook in
it's face, his charges will hatch into larvae about one third of an inch
long and then wiggle waggle in tides and currents, out to sea.</p>
<p>During the next three month these itty-bitty bubbas loose most of their
good buddies to fish and bird while swimming around the top hundred feet
or so of water feeding on teeny organisms and the remains of tuna sandwiches
discarded by finicky anglers. This three month period sees the young ling
cod grow to about three inches in length. About this time they realize that
they were not born with swim bladders so they immediately sink like fishy
rocks to the bottom of the sea where they settle in sandy surroundings,
well away from rocks where they would quickly become lunch for any of the
many varieties of rock fish as well as their hungry cousins who live there.</p>
<p>For six to eight months the juvenile lingcod hang out in the sand, eating
baby sole, small crustacean creepy-crawlies and other delicacies. During
this period they grow to thirteen or fourteen inches long, gain a mouthful
of sharp toothies and develop an attitude that drives them toward the "know
no fear, no free lunch" ambiance of the rocks. Ling grow a lot faster
than most rock fish and within three years of hatching, most have reached
the present recreational fishery minimum size limit of twenty-two inches.</p>
<p>Lingcod don't move around a lot. Mama lings go from their deep spot to
the shallow reefs and back again, East to West. Males move even less, eschewing
the depths favored by their lady loves. . .probably because the females
would eat their asses if they ventured into really deep water. Cordell Bank
lLingcod don't move south to hang at the Farallons and few lingcod at the
pimple venture South of the Main Island. Five miles seems to be about the
limit of a lingcod's lifetime North - South peregrinations. This writer
interprets this information to mean that if a large area was "fished
out" of lings, it might take a long time to restore the fishery without
help.</p>
<p>There are many ideas floating around concerning the maintenance of a
healthy lingcod fishery. This part of the California coast sees a lot of
legal fish taken that have yet to become sexually mature. Only about 30%
of 22 inch females are sexually mature whereas 80% of the males of that
size are ready to do it. This would dictate that a larger limit be imposed.
At 26 inches, all males are mature and about 60 to 70 percent of the females
can get gravid. A larger size limit might be looked at. Tough mouth tissue
and the lack of a swim bladder mean that most lingcod survive a catch and
release. A prohibition of taking lingcod from December to March would allow
a much greater survival of both the males and the incubating eggs in their
care. This would require a neat bit of re-educating many anglers to accept
catch and release fishing during these months. Since limits of blue, olive
and yellow school fish are readily filled, maybe fishing for these species
with single hooks and lighter gear would satisfy angler blood lust and help
save lingcod and the slow growth hard head rock fish, i.e.: golden eyes,
fan tails, canaries, vermilion's etc.</p>
<p>Another possible tack would be to lower the limit to three fish. The
DFG folks tell us that a three fish limitwould reduce the recreational harvest
by at least 10%. It seems that five fish limits are most common when the
males are guarding the incubating eggs and are therefore even more prone
to get snappy with anything nearing the nest. As our population grows and
fishing technology advances it stands to reason that our lingcod and rockfish
stocks need protection. In the past when warning flags have gone up, management
actions have been too little, too late to stem the fishery's decline.</p>
<p>The DFG bulletin on the web, from which this story was based, uses information
from studies made in the 1960's and 1980's and comparisons thereof. Some
factors have probably changed, But if we are really interested in being
able to enjoy catching lingcod and rockfish ten years from now it is incumbent
on us to get active. Fish and game laws are changed by public demand or
by corporate and organizational lobbying. Talk with the folks who are knowledgeable
from day to day dealings with this fishery and get their views and suggestions
exposure in the corridors of Sacramento, where they can help insure a healthy
fishery for the future. -Kim Gale</p>

<h4><font color="#FF0000">A Day of Fat Little Fish</font></h4>
<p>Two minutes into my first turn at manning a trolling rod and boof! I got
a hit. "No damned skunk this time around", I thought, as I reeled
in my first albacore in fifteen years. A bit of exertion and I looked down
at my catch beside the boat. "Jeez, it looks like a friggen penguin!
The gaff was bared and Mr. bird, fish, or whatever the hell it was, went
straight toward Tibet. There seemed to be no stopping this weird little
wiggling, winged beastie with the big yellow eyes. Fifty feet down, just
out of sight, the fifty pound test line put a brake to this foolishness
and the albacore came rather meekly to surface. The gaff was bared and,
damn! there he goes again. After about five dives, deck hand Cary Kataoka
finally put the gaff to the twelve pound albacore which promptly bled all
over my left leg. Welcome to the day of fat little fish with big, bad attitudes.</p>
<p>Three 'o clock that morning, August the twenty-second, fourteen intrepid
souls had set forth with Captain Mick and a crew of three aboard the New
Superfish for a scheduled twenty-one hour hegira into angst. . . lost from
the sight of land, looking for a fish, that as far as I could tell, had
long vanished from the face of the earth.</p>
<p>A twenty-four hour albacore trip several years ago on the Cobra had yielded
this writer two rock cod as the sun set over the Farallons. Others on this
venture had similar tales of woe: "Skunked in "83, haven't been
out since." "Why pay $200 to go fishless, when for fifty bucks,
I can feed the family snapper for a month?" Even among the these naysayers
however, there was an aura of optimism. Three days before, Mick and crew
had found fifty-seven fish on an unseasonable rainy day. The optimists amongst
us took in stride the death of most of the live bait on the way West. To
the East the rosy fingered dawn bid the dark of night adieu.</p>
<p>Ensuring everyone aboard a somewhat equal chance to land an albacore
requires jack-booted adherence to a system devised somewhere off the coast
off San Clemente during the Korean Police Action. Fisherfolk are divided
into teams of four who take turns trolling the tuna jigs 75 to 150 feet
behind the boat which cruises at about five knots. When an albacore bites
the jig, bedlam ensues. "Fish on!" "Free spool!" "Let
yer line out!" "Let em slide." This rather dim witted writer
was able to fathom the meaning of this litany. In order to get one's bait
bit, it's necessary to get it where the fish are. Thus, those who get their
bait in the area where the first fish took the plunge will be most likely
to soon fighting a penguin, er, fish. Those trollers not bit, let their
lines out for another 50 to 100 feet while the other dozen or some folks
plop their bait in the water and let it fall back a couple of hundred feet
(aptly named, 'the slide') as they work their way toward the stern. The
good captain slows the boat, those trollers not hooked up retrieve their
jigs and grab lighter gear to join their brethren who are now mooching or
throwing lures.</p>
<p>Seven-thirty that morning, and all fourteen of us were deep into the
arcane science of angling for albacore and the fish began snarfing trolled
lures with increasing frequency as the morning brightened. It should be
noted that when albacore get lockjaw, this trolling thing can become a monumental
bore. One is poised to leap to the gunnels at the first cry of "fish
on", but after a few hours, poise turns to lethargy, itches start in
places that haven't been scratched in years and improper thoughts flood
angst-ridden minds. On this day there was none of that stuff. No more than
twenty minutes passed between hook-ups and one had scarcely opportunity
to watch the many humpback whales that were performing rolls and fluke flaps
within a few hundred yards of the boat. Not a cloud in the sky, a real scorcher,
a flat oily ocean rippled only by breaking bait . . . and then we really
got into some serious fishing!</p>
<p>Dennis White of Berkeley avoided the bump and rush in the stern, began
throwing a 4 oz. dart from the bow and hooking up with fish while John Hay
began casting a heavier copper and silver dart with the same results. I
followed suit and soon locked up with an eighteen pounder on my super bantam
reel 'n bass pole. It was a twenty minute yo-yo battle before I boated the
beast with the bemused help of a very patient Tyler Rost</p>
<p>Deck hands Tyler and Cary exhorted this mostly inexperienced group to
do the right thing while bringing their fish to gaff, while Ron Nass, skipper
of the Pacific Queen out of Sausalito, himself fishing albacore for only
the second time, took the daunting task of keeping order among the trollers,
allowing the meek their proper turns and curbing the greedheads.</p>
<p>The day got hotter. The fishing got better. Birds going bananas. Dorado
were spotted but not caught. Something bit off the 100 lb. test boat line.
A magic day! I wouldn't have been totally surprised to see a giant squid
chewing on the main Farallon Island while in turn, being munched by Moby
Dick. Seven miles West of the Islands . . . no free lunch here, Bub. More
and more time was spent mooching or throwing darts, or in my own case Kastmasters
and chewed up, old B-2's. Most anything worked as long as you cranked and
then let the lure flutter down for a few seconds. Some folks were getting
a bit spasmy 'about the forearms or just plain tired enough to let their
dead 'chovie hang in the water. In a sort of weird rite of retribution,
they were getting bit . . . and forced to fight. Troopers John Hay, Gene
Covello, Dennis White, the insatiable Dennis Kwong and this writer fished
'til the blessed end, perhaps in the knowledge that there might well never
be another day like this to catch these fat little mothers.</p>
<p>By three-thirty in the afternoon, all the boat's fish storage facilities
and many individual coolers were stuffed with albacore. The sun was hotter
than ever. It was time to get back to Emeryville or risk a load of partially
cooked tuna. We caught 181 albacore. No one had ever heard of any party
boat catching that many fish in Northern California. On the way in we were
the talk of the fleet. Mick was unable to get off the radio fielding congratulations.
However, down the hill a tad, The Wild Wave with twenty "meat hunters"
out of Half Moon Bay had gaffed 435 albacore that day. Oh well, so much
for a record, but we probably had more fun. How many of their fish were
caught on 15 pound line and B-2's?</p>
<p>Smiling Gene Covello won the $140 jackpot with a 34 pounder. Gene nabbed
15 fish while Dennis White of Berkeley and Dennis Kwong of Alameda landed
17 apiece. The redoubtable John Hay caught most of his 13 fish tossing iron,
and everyone else caught at least five fish despite the onus that several
folks were fishing on the ocean for the first time. Captain Menigoz finally
got off the radio midway across the Bay and as the sun was sliding behind
Alcatraz, and reiterated, "never a better albacore day!"</p>

<h4><font color="#F7222B">Cod Notes:</font></h4>
<p>Mr. Jones' face is askew between concentration and anticipation, he works
the rod furioso, first in short jerks then raises it, reeling in a yard
of line then letting his jig flutter back down to the rocks. He repeats
this maneuver varying the motions slightly. The rod bends a bit, one crank
on the reel and the rod tip plunges toward China. The face crinkles into
a big grin.</p>
<p>"Ya gotta keep workin it" is Mr. Jones' motto and secret to
catching ling cod with a variety of small bars and jigs. The type of lure
is secondary in this battle to outwit the territorial and recalcitrant big
vermillion or golden eye rockcod and his ugly distant cousin, the ling cod.
Technique is 80% of the game and technique is where this writer and many
other rock cod fisherman are a bit lacking.</p>
<p>So what are are we fish/duffers to do? Try to dredge up real estate on
the edge of the continental shelf? Give up on the big bottom fish and crank
grubs and shrimp flies up through the school fish? Tell ya what. . .just
hook a live anchovy on a three way rig and drop it to bottom, Bubba! . .
.and catch fish! If you're enough of a space case to get your lead ball
wedged in a rock, you're out less than a buck for an 8 oz. weight rather
than $6.00, $7.00 or more for a bar or dart. Dick Galli, fishy raconteur
and master rod builder puts it this way, "day-after-day, people are
going to catch more fish, easier on live bait."</p>
<p>All the boats from the Emeryville Sportfishing Center are gearing up
for live bait rockcod fishing this fall and winter. Don and Jay, aboard
the C-Gull II and Kurt on the New Salmon Queen and are going into their
third year using live bait at the Farallons while Art Roby, skipper of the
Huck Finn, pretty much pioneered offering live anchovies on light tackle
to rockcod and lings several years ago. Tony Broglio of the Rapid Transit
still likes 'his iron' but feels that "one should go with the flow."
Tony suggests a grub just above the hook, (shown at left) to help solve
the problem of anchovies being chewed off the hook unbeknownst to the angler.
"At least you'll have something on your hook for the way up and grubs
work well on the retrieve." On working bars on the bottom Tony says
he pulls and lets it drop then yanks and lets drop, much the same as Mr.
Jones. "how do do you keep from catching a rock?" Practice and
lot of money.</p>
<p>"As a rule anchovies will out-perform iron and grubs and most particularly,
shrimp flies, for almost everyone" this from Don Wong of the C-Gull
II. Don went on to offer some really sage advice. "Don't try to be
an expert! Ask your deck hand. He spends five days a week or more on the
ocean and he <b>KNOWS</b> what is happening! He can and will help you catch
fish."</p>
<p>Jay Yokomizo, C-Gull II co-captain, concurs that live bait makes it easier
for novices to catch a lot of fish. Jay concedes that when the fish are
biting, it often makes no difference what you offer. You're going to get
bit! Jay adds that in a strong current, even at two hundred feet, anchovies
work well because fish will bite and hang themselves on the hook.</p>
<p><img "="" class="img-floated-left image-process-small-floated-image" src="/images/derivatives/small-floated-image/kimgale-rockfish.gif"/>
While recently ruminating the vagaries of rockcod fishing
with Emeryville Sportcenter owner/manager Craig Stone this writer picked
up a few thoughts. My assertion that the damn fish seemed to flip-flop in
their preference for bait and techniques every few months was first brushed
aside by the dictum that there are no standards in rockcod fishing. "It's
a matter of personal preference" Craig went on to really answer my
query by offering this advice. "Smaller stuff, (Yosuri, and small grubs),
work better when the fish have a lot of natural stuff to eat. When they
are hungry then they'll go for bars, scampis, shrimp flies with squid and
live bait." It stands to reason that a hungry fish'll eat damn near
anything; so the bigger, the better. Craig continued, "as far as ling
cod go, the really experienced fishermen do better with iron but anchovies
will even the occasional angler's chances at nabbing the buggers.</p>
<p>Live bait is no sure thing for the dummy, however. Fishermen have develop
a feel for how the fish eats the bait and take appropriate action to avoid
whipping the bait out of the fish's mouth or getting robbed." Experience
is the best teacher. The New Huck Finn's Art Roby has re-cently been setting
up his less experienced clients with a big bait hook with two anchovies
hooked through the nose on a short, heavy-duty leader. "Let 'em eat
them for a few seconds, then set the hook gently and start crankin. . .
works good!"</p>
<p>The last few years rockcod fishing has been great right through March.
The fall weather is the best of the year and even in the dead of winter
there are many days of war sunshine mill pond conditions at the Farallons.
The currents and drift slow down allowing use of four to eight ounce weights
which means the fisherperson can use really light gear and experience the
surprising amount of fight a one pound blue or olive rockfish will provide.
Hook on to a five pounder and you've really got a battle.</p>
