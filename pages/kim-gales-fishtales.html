<a href="#anchor144958"><i><font size="+2">Cod Notes:</font></i></a><hr align="LEFT">

<p align="CENTER"><b><font color="#330099" size="+2">The Bite Begins . . .BUT</font></b></p>

<p><font size="+1">Yes, there will be a salmon season! The first weekend got
blown away. During the next week a few hardy souls braved a snotty sea at
the Farallons not knowing whether the were fishing for salmon with incidental
rockcod catches or the other way around. The last few days though, have
seen from one-fish-to-the-rod to limits at Montara and the Deep Reef. As
of the 18th, the bite picked up again after a week of doldrums. It's a bit
of a ride to the beasties but at least Neptune seems to be appeased and
the monotheists amongst us are no longer doubting the designs of their deity.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The crew that do at the Emeryville Sportfishing Center
wish to state emphatically that fishermen without circle hooks will not
get their lines wet. The DFG has been finding a lot of small very dead,
gut-hooked salmon. The fear is, that if folks continue to use J hooks, the
powers that be will decree &quot;trolling only&quot;. Circle hooks save
young fish and their exclusive use will insure mooching this year, and salmon
fishing itself in the future.</font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><b><font color="#330099" size="+1">The Source of Salmon Statutes</font></b></p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/19980518054554im_/http://usafishing.com:80/images/salmon52lb.jpg" width="327" height="265" align="LEFT" naturalsizeflag="3"><font size="+1">Despite the machinations of a seemingly
Byzantine regulation machine: it appears this year's salmon statutes will
be pretty much the same as last year except that the circle hook will replace
the J hook when mooching with 1 pound or less, which pretty well makes the
circle hook ubiquitous . . . at least on party boats fishing for salmonoids.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The Emeryville Sportfishing Center's owner Craig Stone
and New Salmon Queen owner and skipper Kurt Hochburg are members of the
Pacific Fishing Management Council's Salmon Advisory Sub Panel. Besides
having titles too long to fit on any T-shirt known to man, Craig and Kurt
will have spent March and early April digesting the data given to them by
those curious folk who count, prod and squeeze salmonoids, and then enter
their findings, drippings, etc. into a computer in a most scientific way.
Craig, Kurt and the other panel members then draft options for the coming
salmon season based on the biologist's guidelines which are pretty much
formulated on directives of the Endangered Species Act.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The before mentioned Pacific Fisheries Management Council
is made up of representatives from Washington, Idaho, Oregon and California
including those from commercial, sport and Native American tribal fishing
concerns. This council is responsible for setting salmon seasons and regulations
that will consider the impacts on all those concerned. Still with me? Maybe
you wanna read about how not to jerk your circle hook . . .elsewhere on
this site.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">So then, all these PFMC regulations are subject to the
approval of the National Marine Fishery which reports to the US Dept. of
Commerce. The Endangered Species Act pretty much drives the modus operandi
of this NMF outfit which is currently headed by Bill Hogarth, a good guy,
who replaced the despised Hilda 'De-something or other', who garnered the
loathing of damn near every West Coast person involved with any type of
fishing.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The PFMC recommended that circle hooks only be used mooching
for salmon for the entire season. Like last year, there will be a 24&quot;
limit until the first of July when anglers will have to keep their first
two fish regardless of the size. On September seventh, the 24&quot; limit
will be reinstated until the end of the season. This proposed set of regulations
has been floated out for public feedback and then was adopted, despite widespread
insanity and political craziness, during the mid-April meeting of the council
in Portland.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">So, now ya know?</font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><b><font color="#330099" size="+2">What to do, (and what not
to do) with Your Circle Hook</font></b></p>

<p><font size="+1">Other than the fact that El Nino has not dispersed all
the salmon to Oregon or Wake Island, there's one sure thing the early salmon
season on the southside has taught us. Those who stand at the rail jerking
it, ain't  going to get fish other than the occasional sand dab. The word
is, when you're using circle hooks, DON'T SET THE HOOK!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">For lo, these many years, the rail regulars fished J hooks
using nary a jerk and watched dingbats from around the world flail away
and still catch salmon. Then, recently due to decree or practicality, we
fished gitz-its and/or fillets where, if you didn't set the hook and set
it quickly, you went home both empty handed and as a candidate for klutzdom.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">This is the first year of the circle hook, kiddies. . .
and quite probably, will be the way of salmon fishing for several seasons
to come. This circle hook seems to do a decent job of reducing the kill
rate on throw-back salmon. When the bait is eaten from a circle hook, the
fish is much more likely to be hooked by the jaw rather than by the gut.
Salmon are a wimpy lot . . . some die just from being looked at the wrong
way. By and large though, most will survive a bit of lip rip 'n jaw bend
if handled lightly or not at all.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Advise from those who should know, on the use of the circle
hooks, range from &quot;Use 'em just like you're supposed to use a J hook.&quot;
from Captain Kurt of the New Salmon Queen to a stronger admonishment from
Mike Aughney of FishSite on the net: &quot;Don't set the hook like you do
with a J hook. You will miss the fish every time. Most boats, (from South
of Pigeon Point) are reporting that they are missing many of their fish
due to the new circle hook requirement.&quot; An update from the crew that
do at the Emeryville Sportfish Center reveals that most folk are seeing
the light on circle hook usage and are missing fewer fish. That is, other
than professional grumps and people with severe brain lesions.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">So, let the fish eat the bait and slowly reel down on the
fish. This will let the hook slide into the jaw line. When your pole really
begins to bend, you can play them as usual.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The California Department of Fish and Game says that there
are more than a million salmon swimming around our coast at this writing.
That's almost twice the count of two years ago and 25% more than last year,
which was a year of truly big fish. What does this all mean? The fish are
there. The skippers will find them. It's up to you to catch them. Pay attention
to the advise of the skipper and crew and don't jerk. -Kim Gale</font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><b><font color="#330099" size="+2">The Crew That Do</font></b></p>

<p><font size="+1">The salmon season opener in effect heralds a new season
for the Emeryville Sportfishing Center. Much remains the same but there
are some neat changes in the wings. The <b>C-Gull II</b> under the dual
skippership of <b>Jay Yokomizo</b> and first time daddy, <b>Don</b> &quot;would
you do that in your house?&quot; <b>Wong</b>, is sporting new upholstery
and carpets plus a new prop for better get up and go.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Talking about get up 'n go; Captain &quot;slow-boat&quot;
<b>Harry Garabedian</b> now has the fastest boat in the harbor with his
<b>New Seeker</b>, a 50' Delta with the big bow. Harry and Ralph have equipped
their pride and joy with a TV, V.C.R. and a micro-wave oven. Harry is planning
to forgo Mexico next winter to stick around, and along with the aforementioned
Jay and Don, offer combo rockfish and crab trips.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Sportfishing Center owner and chief cat-caresser, Craig
Stone explained the decision to offer crabbing: &quot;we had thought that
the crab thing might be just too boring along with the ride to the Farallons,
but it appears that people will go through damn near anything to get crabs.
So, crabs they'll get, and with as much comfort as we can provide.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Back to the season at hand: <b>Mick Menigoz</b> has been
watching whales and anything else that gets on or above the surface from
the wheel house of the <b>New Superfish</b>. He is anxious to resume his
role as 'harbor fish-ho'. &quot;I'll fish for anything for money&quot; smirks
the affable Captain Mick.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Skipper <b>Jack Collier</b> has readied his <b>Rapid Transit</b>
for opening day and is ready to mooch while <b>Chris Smith</b> aboard the
<b>Captain </b>Hook is getting ready for his bay forays. Chris may fish
beyond the gate later in the season but with halibut being caught in mid-march,
he's just waiting for live bait on April 19.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Fishing cheerleader and <b>New Huck Finn</b> Captain <b>Art
Roby</b> will start the season putting salmon in the box, but will be targeting
halibut, bass and rockfish now as live bait has become available.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Far to the right, <b>Kurt Hochburg</b> is readying the
<b>New Salmon </b>Queen for the opener after a tough, but overall successful
crab season. Kurt said he had no idea what the El Nino thing will do to
salmon fishing this year. &quot;I just want to go fishin!&quot; </font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><font color="#330099" size="+2">GOOD EATS</font></p>

<p align="CENTER"><font color="#330099" size="+2">Wild Wahoo Stew</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">By far the most difficult aspect of cooking a perfect wahoo
stew is catching a wahoo. Most folk have never seen this fastest of all
fish that streak from the horse latitudes south . . . then twice around
the boat while your reaching for your reel grip. And of those that have,
most have seen only a fleeting wake and a shredded leader. So unless you've
got money and biceps to burn, get your wahoo steaks from the fortunate angler
just back from Baja, South Texas or Carolina. Now remember, we're talking
wahoo here, not yahoo.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The wahoo is the biggest of all mackerels, up to 150 lbs.
with special attributes: a hinged jaw, (like an anaconda), very large, sharp
teeth, the ability to swim at close to 60 miles per hour and, like most
fish, a rather limited agenda; i.e.: bite! So basically, we have a toothy
torpedo, boasting very firm white flesh, without the oil and pungent taste
of it's little cousins. So what to do with two pounds of frozen wahoo flank?
Well, let me tell you how to make a great wahoo stew. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Ingredients:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">2 lbs. wahoo, dorado or swordfish.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">(Halibut can be used, but you need to marinate in lime
juice, 2 hrs.)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">2 potatoes cut into bite size cubes.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">1 large onion, thinly sliced.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">1 medium green bell pepper cut into 1&quot; squares.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">1 large Anaheim pepper cut into 1/2&quot; squares.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">3 stalks of celery cut in 1/2&quot; pieces.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">4 medium size tomatoes or 6 romas.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">  (A 16 oz. can of tomatoes will work.)</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">16 oz. fish stock or chicken broth.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Salt, pepper, basil, oregano and chili powder to taste.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Salsa and/or Tabasco sauce to taste.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Optional:</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">A dozen clams or mussels in the shell.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">1/2 lb. or less of raw medium shrimp.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Cut the skin off the beast and about 1/4 inch or so of
the dark meat next to the skin. Cut the remaining white meat into one inch
or one and a half inch cubes, (depending on whether your jaws are hinged
for bigger bites). Bring two cups of water to quick boil in your steamer
and steam the wahoo for ten to twelve minutes. Put steamed wahoo cubes aside
and keep that water . . .frothy stuff 'n all. Briefly saut&eacute; the onions,
pepper pieces and celery chunks ' til onion is iridescent.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Add two cups of fish stock, (a 16 oz can of chicken broth
will work fine) to your water and boil your potato, onion, pepper and celery
pieces for five minutes or so in a large pot. In another sauce pan bring
two cups of water to a boil and add tomatoes. Cook for five minutes, remove
tomato skins and dump whole thing in your put and season with salt, pepper,
basil, oregano and chili powder to taste. This stew really works well with
Tabasco sauce or hot salsa. Cook at a very slow boil (or a roil, if you
will), for thirty minutes and it's ready. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Now then, for an added touch, add a dozen clams or mussels
about fifteen minutes before taking off the stove. To really top it off,
introduce a half pound of cleaned, raw medium size shrimp to the concoction
for the last five minutes. Woof! Be sure to have a bunch of sourdough bread.
This concoction is well complemented by either a light red wine or a chardonay.</font></p>

<p><b><font size="+1">Fillet That Salmon!</font></b><font size="+1"> </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Some folks, for reasons of heredity, or a love of spitting
fish bones, will instinctively cut up a salmon into steaks. This is not
say that barbequed or broiled salmon steaks are pass&eacute;, but by filleting
your fish, you'll get to eat more of it and in an infinitely greater number
of ways. Plus you'll bypass the little bones between your teeth or under
your plate. Filleting a salmon is an easy thing. Cut behind the collar to
the backbone, then along the backbone to the tail. Save the stomach meat
for salmon burger or loaf and don't forget the meat along the backbone that
can be easily shaved off to be lightly fried with scrambled eggs and chives.
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Your salmon fillet can be easily boned with small snub-nosed
pliers before being poached, steamed, baked, broiled, grilled or smoked.<br>

<p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+3">The 1997 Fish Wrap</font></b><a name="anchor133072"></a></p>

<p><font size="+1">Quite a year for fish stories. The best since 1906, when
in early April of that year, hundreds of barracuda inexplicably beached
themselves on San Francisco's Embarcadero near Washington Street causing
widespread fear and loathing. Proper women screamed, improper ones moaned,
horses were bitten about the fetters and strong men repaired to the Barbary
Coast for another morning nip. One local wag was heard to lament, &quot;why
me, Lord? Next It'll probably be a Godamned earthquake!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Getting back toward reality: at the Emeryville Sportfishing
Center, where soothsayer of all things fishy; Craig Stone, waxed poetic
on the year that was. This writer failed to elicit much commentary on the
first two months of last year when fishing San Pablo Bay and upper San Francisco
Bay was an adventure avoiding Big Valley riff-raff bound for <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/19980518054554im_/http://usafishing.com:80/images/Ssturgn.gif" width="216" height="41" align="LEFT" naturalsizeflag="3">Guam. The sturgeon
folks did pretty well along the Alameda Rock Wall and points South, but
by March, most of the action was that of folks getting ready for the salmon
opener. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">&quot;In March, Fish and Game claimed that there was the
third largest concentration of salmon off our coast in the fifty years of
tallying such data,&quot; <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/19980518054554im_/http://usafishing.com:80/images/salmongoldengate.jpg" width="144" height="217" align="RIGHT" naturalsizeflag="3">Craig mused. Opening
day confirmed the high hopes. The fish were as big as one would expect in
July and limits were the rule. It was the start of, &quot;a very good year&quot;,
according to Mr. Stone. &quot;Big fish, a fast start, an unbelievable April.&quot;
</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The ocean got real snotty in May so the salmon folks took
up halibut fishing and enjoyed the fruits of a spectacular early butt season.
This writer hooked a big halibut on the Berkeley Pier in late March which
was a sort of a preview of the next couple of months for halibut fishers.
April and May saw a two big fish per rod average on most trips to the Berkeley
flats on South. This unexpected fishy bonus proved serendipitous for Kurt,
Harry and the salmon folk who day after day were turned around by the nastiness
at Point Bonita only to offer their clients a real good day of butt kicking
on the Bay. Craig feels that the three fish limit instituted in '96 may
have really helped last year's halibut season. &quot;It was the best April
and May ever for halibut. The fish were of the size one would expect in
July and August.&quot; Halibut showed early and left early. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">&quot;The commercial guys got fat on halibut and while
the sport fishermen abided by lowered limits, a slew of commercial folk
fished the Bay with no limits other than what the market could bear&quot;,
Craig went on to say, &quot;and of course, they did absolutely nothing to
protect it's own industry. There is a growing movement to put the Bay off
limits entirely to commercial fishermen while saving it for the sport anglers,
who are the only ones taking the initiatives to save their fishery.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The ocean mellowed in June, and as the halibut fishery
faded, there was good salmon fishing day in and day out through the rest
of the summer. When asked about the results of the different tackle restrictions
and size limits during the '97 season, Craig said that no data has been
released to date, but March meetings of the National Maritime Fishery Board
should provide a lot of insight into the results of the rather Byzantine
array of rules and regulations imposed on salmon sport fisher persons. &quot;We
can be sure of one thing&quot;, Craig promised, &quot;the circle hook is
here to stay. It really does the job that it was designed to do, that of
hooking fish by their mouths rather than by their gut.&quot; Craig went
on to explain that other threatened fisheries do not need the circle hook
since bass and halibut rarely swallow a hook.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The last couple of months of the salmon season was a bit
scratchy, particularly in late October, but a lot of truly huge fish tasted
the milk of human kindness while barely fitting in the nets that assisted
their passage from sea to fish box. As luck would have it, as the salmon
split to scratch the gravel of their spawning grounds in record numbers,
the rock cod and ling cod went on a major bite that lasted 'til the end
of the year. According to Mr. Stone, '97 was a banner year for rock fish.
&quot;The school fish were bigger than they have been for years and the
limit rate was almost one hundred percent. A few days of bad weather, or
times when the focus was on ling cod, were the only ocassions that we didn't
get full limits.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="+1">The ling cod fishery has, however, taken a hit by commercial
trawlers. There were some great days of ling fishing in late October and
early November, but most of the fish were ten pounds or less and generally,
the toothy critters were a bit evasive. This ling cod situation will be
dealt with by new regulations next year. The limit will go from five fish
to three per day and the length limit will increase two inches to 24&quot;.
The commercial catch will be quite severely curtailed, (for rock fish as
well as lings), which should give the ling a chance to recover and make
the school fish angling even better. This bodes well for that curious, bizarre
angler who would use light black bass gear with eight pound line and a two
oz. jig to play with their fish. Yet another regulation will limit three
bacaccio to the bag next year. This will not mean a great deal to those
fishing the Farallons, but will definitely cut down on the size of gunny
sacks for the folks who fish out of Bodega Bay. </font></p>

<p><font size="+1">Striped Bass were not targeted often by the Crew That Do
from the Emeryville Sportfishing Center, but a lot were caught incidentally
while fishing for halibut. The bass seemed to have forgotten a </font><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/19980518054554im_/http://usafishing.com:80/images/stripper.gif" width="112" height="42" align="LEFT" naturalsizeflag="3"><font size="+1">lot of their traditional itinerary milestones and are
now widely dispersed through the bay systems much of the year. There was
a brief flurry of striped bass at the towers and the Pacifica beaches but
not as pronounced a run as in years past. Chris Smith of the Captain Hook
limited day after day for a while in September before moving to San Rafael
for the winter. &quot;The striper fishery is improving&quot;, promises Craig,
&quot;some years there's just so much going on that we don't specifically
target the linesiders.&quot;</font></p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/19980518054554im_/http://usafishing.com:80/images/albacore4.jpg" width="205" height="327" align="LEFT" naturalsizeflag="3"><font size="+1">Then there was the tuna thing . . .&quot;We
may never see another fishing event like this in Northern California&quot;,
this from a behind-the-counter cynic who is not given to superlatives except
those directed toward his cats. There were reports of albacore within forty
miles of the coast in late July. The party boats out of Santa Cruz and Half
Moon Bay began getting decent counts, (actually the best counts in years)
in mid August. Then the dam broke. On August 22nd, the Superfish with Mick
Menigoz at the helm, pulled in 190 albacore for 16 anglers. This was an
astounding catch and remained that, even though the Sailfish from Sausalito
nailed 212 and Half Moon Bay's Wild Wave gaffed a seemingly impossible 435
fish that day. The fishing stayed hot for weeks as the weather allowed.
The catches were much smaller in number but the fish got bigger and bigger.
60 lbs., 70 lbs and then unheard of beasts, weighing 80 pounds and more.
A world record albacore weighing more than ninety pounds was the capper.
Blue fin tuna were being caught regularly plus a few dorado, and marlin.
No piranha. At his writing, at the first of the new year, they are still
getting monster albacore on a regular basis off Santa Cruz. Jeez, who would
have thought?</font></p>

<p>Late October or early November, in years past, saw a small, curious group
of the good, the bad and the ugly from the Emeryville Sportfishing Center
peregrinate to work their magic on or near the waters of San Jose de Cabo
in Baja California Sur, Mexico. One year Don Wong caught and released most
of the resident marlin community. Another year saw tripmaster Craig Stone
mistakenly busted as the kingpin of all kingpins during a midnight chip
shot practice soiree on some 'malecon' or 'nother.</p>

<p>This year was different. Less weird, you might venture? Oh no . . . just
a lot more folks, a lot more fishy stories and then, Halloween to boot.</p>

<p>Twenty-six people boarded the non-stop flight from SFO at eleven o'clock
on a Saturday morning, bound for eight days and seven nights in San Jose
Del Cabo, a modest burg, 'bout twenty miles East of the glitziness that
is Cabo San Lucas. The one airport that serves this part of the world is
in San Jose Del Cabo, thus insuring the troop a short mid-afternoon ride
to the very spiffy Tropicana Inn, a stone's throw from the waters of confluence
between The Pacific and the Sea of Cortez.</p>

<p>Two folks came to shop and loll. The other twenty-four assembled on the
beach dark 'n early the next morning to assemble as twelve pre-ordained
teams, each in a super panga, with canvas cover and center cockpit, from
the vaunted Victor's Fleet. The boats loaded up on live bait, the pangeros
cutting a dashing silhouette, casting their nets in the dawn. Eleven boatloads
ventured west toward San Lucas, where within an hour, they began a morning-long
orgy of fighting modest sized dorado and yellowfin tuna. One boat, it's
pangarooni undoubtedly bribed by the invariably intuitive Frank Salazar,
went North to a spot near the Gordo Bank where Mr. Salazar caught the first
day's jackpot, a thirty-one pound yellowfin.</p>

<p>Monday morning was more of the same except that Sunday's light winds
died and the one boat that headed North carried two of the six women fisher
folk; Beth Smith and Cathy Fletcher. Beth hooked into the largest dorado
she had ever seen, (and she has seen a lot of 'em). Beth's dodo did the
tail walk, this walk and that walk, then walked (or swam), away. All aboard
agreed that it was at least a fifty pounder. On the western front, Craig
Stone, (keeper of lame animals) took a step toward lameness, himself, struggling
to land Monday's top fish, a yellowfin that weighed in at twenty-eight pounds.
However, the ubiquitous Frank Salazar pre-empted &quot;struggle sagas&quot;
by wrestling for well over a half hour with a ninety pound recalcitrant
sailfish. Sorry Frank, sailfish, marlin 'n orcas don't count for jackpot
money. Again the fishing was excellent. Lots of quality tuna and dorado
were dredged up, plus a boodle of bonito, which were released along with
yellow fin footballs.</p>

<p>Tuesday was a day off from the rigors and angst of angling. One contingent
went snorkeling while most folks poked around their ever-so-quaint environs.
Craig Stone found a stray cat that would retrieve his wedge shots from one
part the beach to another part of the beach, snoozing German tourists notwithstanding.</p>

<p>Wednesday's rosy fingered dawn triggered the advent of a new force in
the world of big fish bragging rights, that of Mike Mahoney, the svelte,
mild mannered dock czar of the city of Emeryville. Against all odds, our
Mr. Mahoney proved, in a manner of speaking, that lightning can indeed strike
the same spot twice. Wednesday morning the fleet motored toward Cabo San
Lucas where under the bright blue sky, the sea of glass began giving up
her fruits of yellowfin and dorado in bunches. Virtually no trolling here,
folks. Just fly line an anchovy with a half ounce rubber core 'n gird 'yer
loins. The above lauded, Mike Mahoney caught the day's jackpot, a thirty-four
pound dorado.</p>

<p>Thursday was more of the same. Everyone caught both tuna and dorado and
the jackpot fish was again garnered by &quot;Iron Mike&quot;, this time
a forty-nine pound yellowfin that tested the good harbormaster's resolve
in a fifty minute marathon. As the day before, there were countless hookups
and subsequent release of bonita.</p>

<p>Friday was a day to rest weary arms 'n torso and to prepare for a night
of Halloween frivolity. A group of eight motored up to Hank Schram's Baja
digs for a cocktail or two and were set upon by Chris Schram, makeup artist
extraodinaire. While most of the folks were made to look positively goulish,
Don Wong was reincarnated as a trollop that might well straighten the wattles
of old turkeys to Plymouth Rock and back. The costume party then moved West
to Cabo and danced the night away at Kokomo's, a trendy new nightery. Meanwhile,
another intrepid group of revelers from the Emeryville ranks congregated
at the Giggling Marlin, where one could be, and several were, strung up
by the ankles and fed tequila laced jello. That was early in the evening.
The real fun came later.</p>

<p>Saturday morning and all of God's little wanderers from the night of
the dead were herded on to the bus at 11 o'clock for a quick jaunt to the
airport and a non-stop flight, and late afternoon landing in San Francisco.
Reflecting for a moment, on the seemingly better than usual fishing on this
excursion, Craig said that while some wags attributed the good angling to
El Nino, many knowledgeable folks felt that the weather phenomenon was just
incidental. &quot;We were where there were a lot of hungry fish.&quot; People
who know where the fish are, and enthusiastic fisher folk mean a lot of
caught fish, year after year.</p>

<p>Talk to Craig, or any of the crew that do at the Emeryville Sportfishing
Center, about next year!<hr align="LEFT"></p>

<p align="CENTER"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+3">Daaaady! Where do lingcod
come from?</font></b><a name="anchor137201"></a></p>

<p>Good question, princess.&quot; Daddy don't know the difference between
a lingcod and a harpsicod, so dauntless daughter checks the net, the web,
the thingee, and lo and behold, she alights at http://www.psmfc.org. /~wvanbusk/,
otherwise configured as Fish Bulletin 176. Once there, she'll find, under
&quot;Lingcod&quot;:</p>

<p>&quot;In California, lingcod egg masses are deposited from November to
early March in rocky habitats (Miller and Geibel 1973). Lingcod egg masses
have been observed to depths of 97 m (O'Connell 1993). Water current flow
is necessary for gas exchange and prevention of high mortality within the
egg mass (Giorgi and Congleton 1984), and nests are typically located in
areas of water movement. Male lingcod guard the egg mass from predators
during incubation (Hart 1973). Removal of the male causes a high incidence
of egg loss to predators (Low and Beamish 1978). Incubation takes about
seven weeks in the Puget Sound area, and is probably briefer in California
(Miller and Geibel 1973). Newly hatched larvae are 7-10 mm in length (Hart
1973).</p>

<p>After hatching, young lingcod are pelagic until they are about 70 mm
long. Larvae and juveniles have been commonly found in the upper 30 m of
the water column in the Gulf of the Farallones, with density decreasing
with distance from shore.&quot;</p>

<p>Now then, this is good stuff if you're a marine biologist or a glutton
for dense reading. There's about 25,000 words on lingcod and rock fish in
these DFG bulletins. Herewith, this writer offers a translation that touches
on the how's, where's and whatzit's on lingcod.</p>

<p>It seems that missus lingcod makes her longest trip of the year sometime
between September and November for a brief fling in the rocks with a much
smaller male. Once she has relieved herself of her large egg mass and sees
to it that they are well spermed by the male in a most likely, loveless
ritual, the lovelorn lady lingster returns to her deeper, less turbulent
lair, leaving Mr. Ling to guard the spawning nest.</p>

<p>They have mated in a relatively shallow location allowing the currents
and tidal surge to cause gas exchanges within the egg mass. This movement
within the egg mass ensures a high survival rate. The male at this point
has a six or seven week watch until the eggs hatch. The survival of the
incubating eggs is dependent on the good guardianship of daddy ling. If
he can restrain himself from chomping a lure or an anchovy with a hook in
it's face, his charges will hatch into larvae about one third of an inch
long and then wiggle waggle in tides and currents, out to sea.</p>

<p>During the next three month these itty-bitty bubbas loose most of their
good buddies to fish and bird while swimming around the top hundred feet
or so of water feeding on teeny organisms and the remains of tuna sandwiches
discarded by finicky anglers. This three month period sees the young ling
cod grow to about three inches in length. About this time they realize that
they were not born with swim bladders so they immediately sink like fishy
rocks to the bottom of the sea where they settle in sandy surroundings,
well away from rocks where they would quickly become lunch for any of the
many varieties of rock fish as well as their hungry cousins who live there.</p>

<p>For six to eight months the juvenile lingcod hang out in the sand, eating
baby sole, small crustacean creepy-crawlies and other delicacies. During
this period they grow to thirteen or fourteen inches long, gain a mouthful
of sharp toothies and develop an attitude that drives them toward the &quot;know
no fear, no free lunch&quot; ambiance of the rocks. Ling grow a lot faster
than most rock fish and within three years of hatching, most have reached
the present recreational fishery minimum size limit of twenty-two inches.</p>

<p>Lingcod don't move around a lot. Mama lings go from their deep spot to
the shallow reefs and back again, East to West. Males move even less, eschewing
the depths favored by their lady loves. . .probably because the females
would eat their asses if they ventured into really deep water. Cordell Bank
lLingcod don't move south to hang at the Farallons and few lingcod at the
pimple venture South of the Main Island. Five miles seems to be about the
limit of a lingcod's lifetime North - South peregrinations. This writer
interprets this information to mean that if a large area was &quot;fished
out&quot; of lings, it might take a long time to restore the fishery without
help.</p>

<p>There are many ideas floating around concerning the maintenance of a
healthy lingcod fishery. This part of the California coast sees a lot of
legal fish taken that have yet to become sexually mature. Only about 30%
of 22 inch females are sexually mature whereas 80% of the males of that
size are ready to do it. This would dictate that a larger limit be imposed.
At 26 inches, all males are mature and about 60 to 70 percent of the females
can get gravid. A larger size limit might be looked at. Tough mouth tissue
and the lack of a swim bladder mean that most lingcod survive a catch and
release. A prohibition of taking lingcod from December to March would allow
a much greater survival of both the males and the incubating eggs in their
care. This would require a neat bit of re-educating many anglers to accept
catch and release fishing during these months. Since limits of blue, olive
and yellow school fish are readily filled, maybe fishing for these species
with single hooks and lighter gear would satisfy angler blood lust and help
save lingcod and the slow growth hard head rock fish, i.e.: golden eyes,
fan tails, canaries, vermilion's etc.</p>

<p>Another possible tack would be to lower the limit to three fish. The
DFG folks tell us that a three fish limitwould reduce the recreational harvest
by at least 10%. It seems that five fish limits are most common when the
males are guarding the incubating eggs and are therefore even more prone
to get snappy with anything nearing the nest. As our population grows and
fishing technology advances it stands to reason that our lingcod and rockfish
stocks need protection. In the past when warning flags have gone up, management
actions have been too little, too late to stem the fishery's decline.</p>

<p>The DFG bulletin on the web, from which this story was based, uses information
from studies made in the 1960's and 1980's and comparisons thereof. Some
factors have probably changed, But if we are really interested in being
able to enjoy catching lingcod and rockfish ten years from now it is incumbent
on us to get active. Fish and game laws are changed by public demand or
by corporate and organizational lobbying. Talk with the folks who are knowledgeable
from day to day dealings with this fishery and get their views and suggestions
exposure in the corridors of Sacramento, where they can help insure a healthy
fishery for the future. -Kim Gale<hr align="LEFT"></p>

<p align="CENTER"><font color="#FF0000" size="+4">A Day of Fat Little Fish</font><a name="anchor141096"></a><br>
Two minutes into my first turn at manning a trolling rod and boof! I got
a hit. &quot;No damned skunk this time around&quot;, I thought, as I reeled
in my first albacore in fifteen years. A bit of exertion and I looked down
at my catch beside the boat. &quot;Jeez, it looks like a friggen penguin!
The gaff was bared and Mr. bird, fish, or whatever the hell it was, went
straight toward Tibet. There seemed to be no stopping this weird little
wiggling, winged beastie with the big yellow eyes. Fifty feet down, just
out of sight, the fifty pound test line put a brake to this foolishness
and the albacore came rather meekly to surface. The gaff was bared and,
damn! there he goes again. After about five dives, deck hand Cary Kataoka
finally put the gaff to the twelve pound albacore which promptly bled all
over my left leg. Welcome to the day of fat little fish with big, bad attitudes.</p>

<p>Three 'o clock that morning, August the twenty-second, fourteen intrepid
souls had set forth with Captain Mick and a crew of three aboard the New
Superfish for a scheduled twenty-one hour hegira into angst. . . lost from
the sight of land, looking for a fish, that as far as I could tell, had
long vanished from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>A twenty-four hour albacore trip several years ago on the Cobra had yielded
this writer two rock cod as the sun set over the Farallons. Others on this
venture had similar tales of woe: &quot;Skunked in &quot;83, haven't been
out since.&quot; &quot;Why pay $200 to go fishless, when for fifty bucks,
I can feed the family snapper for a month?&quot; Even among the these naysayers
however, there was an aura of optimism. Three days before, Mick and crew
had found fifty-seven fish on an unseasonable rainy day. The optimists amongst
us took in stride the death of most of the live bait on the way West. To
the East the rosy fingered dawn bid the dark of night adieu.</p>

<p>Ensuring everyone aboard a somewhat equal chance to land an albacore
requires jack-booted adherence to a system devised somewhere off the coast
off San Clemente during the Korean Police Action. Fisherfolk are divided
into teams of four who take turns trolling the tuna jigs 75 to 150 feet
behind the boat which cruises at about five knots. When an albacore bites
the jig, bedlam ensues. &quot;Fish on!&quot; &quot;Free spool!&quot; &quot;Let
yer line out!&quot; &quot;Let em slide.&quot; This rather dim witted writer
was able to fathom the meaning of this litany. In order to get one's bait
bit, it's necessary to get it where the fish are. Thus, those who get their
bait in the area where the first fish took the plunge will be most likely
to soon fighting a penguin, er, fish. Those trollers not bit, let their
lines out for another 50 to 100 feet while the other dozen or some folks
plop their bait in the water and let it fall back a couple of hundred feet
(aptly named, 'the slide') as they work their way toward the stern. The
good captain slows the boat, those trollers not hooked up retrieve their
jigs and grab lighter gear to join their brethren who are now mooching or
throwing lures.</p>

<p>Seven-thirty that morning, and all fourteen of us were deep into the
arcane science of angling for albacore and the fish began snarfing trolled
lures with increasing frequency as the morning brightened. It should be
noted that when albacore get lockjaw, this trolling thing can become a monumental
bore. One is poised to leap to the gunnels at the first cry of &quot;fish
on&quot;, but after a few hours, poise turns to lethargy, itches start in
places that haven't been scratched in years and improper thoughts flood
angst-ridden minds. On this day there was none of that stuff. No more than
twenty minutes passed between hook-ups and one had scarcely opportunity
to watch the many humpback whales that were performing rolls and fluke flaps
within a few hundred yards of the boat. Not a cloud in the sky, a real scorcher,
a flat oily ocean rippled only by breaking bait . . . and then we really
got into some serious fishing!</p>

<p>Dennis White of Berkeley avoided the bump and rush in the stern, began
throwing a 4 oz. dart from the bow and hooking up with fish while John Hay
began casting a heavier copper and silver dart with the same results. I
followed suit and soon locked up with an eighteen pounder on my super bantam
reel 'n bass pole. It was a twenty minute yo-yo battle before I boated the
beast with the bemused help of a very patient Tyler Rost</p>

<p>Deck hands Tyler and Cary exhorted this mostly inexperienced group to
do the right thing while bringing their fish to gaff, while Ron Nass, skipper
of the Pacific Queen out of Sausalito, himself fishing albacore for only
the second time, took the daunting task of keeping order among the trollers,
allowing the meek their proper turns and curbing the greedheads.</p>

<p>The day got hotter. The fishing got better. Birds going bananas. Dorado
were spotted but not caught. Something bit off the 100 lb. test boat line.
A magic day! I wouldn't have been totally surprised to see a giant squid
chewing on the main Farallon Island while in turn, being munched by Moby
Dick. Seven miles West of the Islands . . . no free lunch here, Bub. More
and more time was spent mooching or throwing darts, or in my own case Kastmasters
and chewed up, old B-2's. Most anything worked as long as you cranked and
then let the lure flutter down for a few seconds. Some folks were getting
a bit spasmy 'about the forearms or just plain tired enough to let their
dead 'chovie hang in the water. In a sort of weird rite of retribution,
they were getting bit . . . and forced to fight. Troopers John Hay, Gene
Covello, Dennis White, the insatiable Dennis Kwong and this writer fished
'til the blessed end, perhaps in the knowledge that there might well never
be another day like this to catch these fat little mothers.</p>

<p>By three-thirty in the afternoon, all the boat's fish storage facilities
and many individual coolers were stuffed with albacore. The sun was hotter
than ever. It was time to get back to Emeryville or risk a load of partially
cooked tuna. We caught 181 albacore. No one had ever heard of any party
boat catching that many fish in Northern California. On the way in we were
the talk of the fleet. Mick was unable to get off the radio fielding congratulations.
However, down the hill a tad, The Wild Wave with twenty &quot;meat hunters&quot;
out of Half Moon Bay had gaffed 435 albacore that day. Oh well, so much
for a record, but we probably had more fun. How many of their fish were
caught on 15 pound line and B-2's?</p>

<p>Smiling Gene Covello won the $140 jackpot with a 34 pounder. Gene nabbed
15 fish while Dennis White of Berkeley and Dennis Kwong of Alameda landed
17 apiece. The redoubtable John Hay caught most of his 13 fish tossing iron,
and everyone else caught at least five fish despite the onus that several
folks were fishing on the ocean for the first time. Captain Menigoz finally
got off the radio midway across the Bay and as the sun was sliding behind
Alcatraz, and reiterated, &quot;never a better albacore day!&quot;<hr align="LEFT"></p>

<p align="CENTER"><b><font color="#F7222B" size="+4">Cod Notes:</font></b><a name="anchor144958"></a><br>
Mr. Jones' face is askew between concentration and anticipation, he works
the rod furioso, first in short jerks then raises it, reeling in a yard
of line then letting his jig flutter back down to the rocks. He repeats
this maneuver varying the motions slightly. The rod bends a bit, one crank
on the reel and the rod tip plunges toward China. The face crinkles into
a big grin.</p>

<p>&quot;Ya gotta keep workin it&quot; is Mr. Jones' motto and secret to
catching ling cod with a variety of small bars and jigs. The type of lure
is secondary in this battle to outwit the territorial and recalcitrant big
vermillion or golden eye rockcod and his ugly distant cousin, the ling cod.
Technique is 80% of the game and technique is where this writer and many
other rock cod fisherman are a bit lacking.</p>

<p>So what are are we fish/duffers to do? Try to dredge up real estate on
the edge of the continental shelf? Give up on the big bottom fish and crank
grubs and shrimp flies up through the school fish? Tell ya what. . .just
hook a live anchovy on a three way rig and drop it to bottom, Bubba! . .
.and catch fish! If you're enough of a space case to get your lead ball
wedged in a rock, you're out less than a buck for an 8 oz. weight rather
than $6.00, $7.00 or more for a bar or dart. Dick Galli, fishy raconteur
and master rod builder puts it this way, &quot;day-after-day, people are
going to catch more fish, easier on live bait.&quot;</p>

<p>All the boats from the Emeryville Sportfishing Center are gearing up
for live bait rockcod fishing this fall and winter. Don and Jay, aboard
the C-Gull II and Kurt on the New Salmon Queen and are going into their
third year using live bait at the Farallons while Art Roby, skipper of the
Huck Finn, pretty much pioneered offering live anchovies on light tackle
to rockcod and lings several years ago. Tony Broglio of the Rapid Transit
still likes 'his iron' but feels that &quot;one should go with the flow.&quot;
Tony suggests a grub just above the hook, (shown at left) to help solve
the problem of anchovies being chewed off the hook unbeknownst to the angler.
&quot;At least you'll have something on your hook for the way up and grubs
work well on the retrieve.&quot; On working bars on the bottom Tony says
he pulls and lets it drop then yanks and lets drop, much the same as Mr.
Jones. &quot;how do do you keep from catching a rock?&quot; Practice and
lot of money.</p>

<p>&quot;As a rule anchovies will out-perform iron and grubs and most particularly,
shrimp flies, for almost everyone&quot; this from Don Wong of the C-Gull
II. Don went on to offer some really sage advice. &quot;Don't try to be
an expert! Ask your deck hand. He spends five days a week or more on the
ocean and he <b>KNOWS</b> what is happening! He can and will help you catch
fish.&quot;</p>

<p>Jay Yokomizo, C-Gull II co-captain, concurs that live bait makes it easier
for novices to catch a lot of fish. Jay concedes that when the fish are
biting, it often makes no difference what you offer. You're going to get
bit! Jay adds that in a strong current, even at two hundred feet, anchovies
work well because fish will bite and hang themselves on the hook.</p>

<p><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/19980518054554im_/http://usafishing.com:80/images/rockfish.gif" width="317" height="157" align="LEFT" naturalsizeflag="3">
While recently ruminating the vagaries of rockcod fishing
with Emeryville Sportcenter owner/manager Craig Stone this writer picked
up a few thoughts. My assertion that the damn fish seemed to flip-flop in
their preference for bait and techniques every few months was first brushed
aside by the dictum that there are no standards in rockcod fishing. &quot;It's
a matter of personal preference&quot; Craig went on to really answer my
query by offering this advice. &quot;Smaller stuff, (Yosuri, and small grubs),
work better when the fish have a lot of natural stuff to eat. When they
are hungry then they'll go for bars, scampis, shrimp flies with squid and
live bait.&quot; It stands to reason that a hungry fish'll eat damn near
anything; so the bigger, the better. Craig continued, &quot;as far as ling
cod go, the really experienced fishermen do better with iron but anchovies
will even the occasional angler's chances at nabbing the buggers.</p>

<p>Live bait is no sure thing for the dummy, however. Fishermen have develop
a feel for how the fish eats the bait and take appropriate action to avoid
whipping the bait out of the fish's mouth or getting robbed.&quot; Experience
is the best teacher. The New Huck Finn's Art Roby has re-cently been setting
up his less experienced clients with a big bait hook with two anchovies
hooked through the nose on a short, heavy-duty leader. &quot;Let 'em eat
them for a few seconds, then set the hook gently and start crankin. . .
works good!&quot;</p>

<p>The last few years rockcod fishing has been great right through March.
The fall weather is the best of the year and even in the dead of winter
there are many days of war sunshine mill pond conditions at the Farallons.
The currents and drift slow down allowing use of four to eight ounce weights
which means the fisherperson can use really light gear and experience the
surprising amount of fight a one pound blue or olive rockfish will provide.
Hook on to a five pounder and you've really got a battle.

<p align="CENTER"><b><font color="#F7222B" size="+3">Cod Notes:</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="+2">Get crabs along with your rockfish in November</font></b></p>

<p>November Seventh. Don't forget it! It's opening day for the sport crab
fishing season and the Crew That Do^1 at the Emeryville Sportfishing Center
will be offering rockcod and crab combination trips to the Farallon Islands.
Anglers will get three to four hours of fishing for chunky rock fish plus
big reds and ling cod, and then a probable limit of six large crabs on the
way home.Two boats: Harry Garabedian's New Seeker and the C-Gull II, skippered
by Don Wong and Jay Yokomizo will be offering these trips every day until
the salmon opener in late March, weather and interest permitting. The Center's
Craig Stone conceded that a couple of years ago he and others had doubts
about offering these trips, &quot;I guess we underestimated the public's
appetite for crab and last year&quot; high prices has made these trips even
more of an attraction. With price of a crab at $10 or more, six crabs plus
a bunch rockcod fillets are a real bargain for $60. Plus, folks get a bracing
day on the ocean. Craig went on to spell out a few more details, We'll be
leaving about 5:30, going straight to the Islands for three or four hours
fishing for rock fish, then targeting larger bottom fish and lings before
leaving to pick up as many traps as it takes to get limits for everyone.
Crabs will be distributed to one and all on an equitable basis.</p>

<p>Plans are being made to provide tired customers the option of having
their crabs cooked following a twelve hour day on the bounding main. There
will be a bit of a learning procedure here, admitted Craig, but the basics
have already been solved in Berkeley so I'm not anticipating any problems.
We had a chance to catch up with Captains Donny Wong and Jay Yokomizo the
other day on yet another run to the Islands for limits of lings and rock
fish. While Don was deftly filleting a boodle of lings, Jay laid out some
more particulars on the coming trips. &quot;The public&quot;  interest is
important here&quot;' ventured Jay. There is a lot of work andexpense involved
in getting fifty or more crab pots together. Even doing all the work oneself
on lines, buoys etc. the cost per pot is nearly $100 a piece. Jay outlined
the details of the crabbing end of the coming combo trips. We'll leave the
Islands a bit after noon and begin winching up the traps which weigh about
eighty pounds. Customers will have bought squid, probably for no more than
$3.00 a person, and will fill our jars with the squid. These jars with perforated
tops go down with the traps and to attract crabs for the next pickup.Hopefully
we^1ll only have to pull a dozen or two traps to get six crabs per person.
The next time out, we'll start where we left off and continue to rotate
through our inventory of traps.Jay felt that he and Don will go on trips
with as few as ten customers. There will have to be a crew of three. One
to drive the boat and two to pull the pots. We'll figure out the economics
of the thing as we go. Quirks and minor problems will be solved as we learn.Sounds
like big fun and a lot of good eatin in November. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Crew That Do</p>

<p>There's a bit of a chill in the air as autumnal changes come to &quot;happy
harbor&quot; at the Emeryville Sportfishing Center. Barry Caranavo of the
Fishing Fool IV is on his way to his Montezuma Slough playground. Jack Collier
is taking the Rapid Transit to Martinez for the winter while Chris Smith
doesn't yet know whether he'll be wintering in Crockett or San Rafael. 
Chris will continue chasing bass aboard Captain Hook from Emeryville until
late October.</p>

<p>Kurt Hochburg plans to fish on his New Salmon Queen every day for salmon
or rock fish/ling cod trips to the Islands until the end of salmon season
on the 1st of November. Kurt will then prepare for commercial crabbing to
start in mid November. Captain Hochburg indicated that the faster-master-deckhand-wunderkind,
Shim Shimokusu, will return next year after this summer sabbatical of fishin
around.</p>

<p>Captain Harry Garabedian will fish out the rest of the salmon season
on the New Seeker and then get ready for the beginning of rockcod, crab
combination trips on November seventh. This is the first winter in some
time that Harry and his advisor, Ralph, will be fishing locally on a day-to-day
basis. Co-skippers Don Wong and Jay Yokomizo of the C-Gull II are going
to be fishing the Farallons and the Bay in October and then rockcod/crab
combo trips all all winter. When weather dictates staying away from the
ocean, the guys will be dredging some sturgeon out of the Bay for Becka
to bark at.</p>

<p>Mick Menigoz and the New Superfish will be available to fish for anything
that anyone wants to fish for as long as it doesn^1t get in the way of his
whale watching expeditions for the Oceanic Society.</p>

<p>Cheerleader and fish rap-master Captain Art Roby of the New Huck Finn
will have live bait all winter and plans on using it in a variety of fishy
pursuits. Art will continue doing light tackle, live bait trips to the islands
for rock fish and ling cod and then later will doing a lot of sturgeon fishing
in the Bays. There should  be plenty of striped bass around to add to the
wintertime action.       -K.G.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Ling Cod and Vegetable Stew from Mary Cook</b></p>

<p>1-1/2 lb. ling cod fillet.</p>

<p>1 large onion.</p>

<p>1 can stewed tomatoes. </p>

<p>1 tbl. olive oil.</p>

<p>1 bunch spinach, (cleaned).</p>

<p>5 medium size potatoes</p>

<p>1 can chicken broth.</p>

<p>Salt to taste.</p>

<p>About 1/2 hour before serving: cut onion lengthwise in half, then crosswise
into 1/4&quot; slices.  In 4 qt. saucepan saute onion in oil until translucent.
 Meanwhile, cut unpeeled potatoes into 3/4&quot; chunks and fish into 1-1/2&quot;
chunks.  Coarsely slice spinach.  Add stewed tomatoes, chicken broth, potatoes
and 1 cup of water to the onions and bring to boil over high heat.  Reduce
heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes or until potato is almost tender.
 Gently stir in spinach and cod.  Cook for another 5 minutes or until fish
is done. Serves four a 300 calorie meal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>El Sobrante Rock Cod from Tony Broglio</b></p>

<p>2 lbs. rock cod or ling cod fillets.</p>

<p>2 ripe tomatoes.</p>

<p>1 onion, (red or white).</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. pepper.</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. powdered thyme.</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. garlic powder.</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. oregano powder.</p>

<p>Slice the tomato and onion.  Place half the tomato and onion slices in
a baking dish.  Put the fish fillets on top and then season with the garlic,
pepper, oregano and thyme to taste.  Place the remaining onions and tomato
on top of seasoned fish, cover with aluminum foil and place in pre-heated
350o oven for roughly 15 minutes, (depending on the thickness of the fillets).
 Good with rice or pasta.</p>

<p><b></b>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Steamed Rock Cod with Hot Black Bean Sauce.</b></p>

<p>from Craig Stone </p>

<p>You'll need a 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 lb. fresh rock fish, gutted, gilled and
scaled. Vermillion, bolinas, china, golden eye, chucklehead or fantail rock
fish are the most prized species for this recipe.</p>

<p>1 fish, (with or without head).</p>

<p>3 or 4 stalks of green onion.</p>

<p>2 or 3 tbl. salted black beans.</p>

<p>2 slices of shredded ginger root.</p>

<p>1 tbl. minced garlic.</p>

<p>1 tsp. soy sauce.</p>

<p>1 tsp. sesame oil.</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. salt.</p>

<p>1/4 to 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper.</p>

<p>Dry the whole fish with a paper towel and sprinkle with salt.  Then combine
beans, ginger, garlic, and pepper and mash into a paste.  Thoroughly mix
this unctuous looking, great smelling goop into the oil and soy sauce. Carefully
rub fish's body with this mixture.  No sense wasting the paste on the head
unless you're going to eat it, or your cat has a perverse hankering for
hot stuff.  Place the green onion on top of the fish in a steamer and cook
for 10 to 15 minutes depending on the size of the fish.</p>

<p>1-1/2 tsp. crushed ginger.</p>

<p>1 tsp sesame oil.</p>

<p>1-1/2 tsp. crushed garlic.</p>

<p>1 tsp. peanut oil.Mix ingredients well to make sauce, then marinade fish
two to four hours.  Score skin of fish at an angle 3 or 4 times on each

<p><b><font size="+2">No Ling Cod Next Year?</font></b></p>

<p>It's Up To You</p>

<p>At a recent week-long meeting of the Pacific Fishery Management Council
in Sacramento, folks weighed options to save an allegedly endangered ling
cod fishery. Unfortunately it seems that the council has lumped the entire
Pacific Coast together when considering this one fishery. Ling cod have
been rare in Southern California since Hector was a pup and recently, the
ling population along the coasts of Oregon and Washington have been ravaged
by commercial enterprises determined to market anything that swims. The
ling cod of Central and Northern California are, by and large, thriving.
Party boats and skiffs targeting lings have seen no decline in recent years.
The main depredations have come from the commercial </p>

<p>guys who are not working with any size restrictions. The ling cod fishing

has in many years and should continue to improve with the new size and quantity

<p>The most severe of the options being considered for passage by the council
at the next meeting in early November is a total ban on the taking of ling

### 01/17/1999


<p align="CENTER"><b><font color="#780712" size="+2">The Year's Fish Wrap </font></b></p>

<p>By Kim Gale</p>

<p>It was an ordinary year for the angling for some species, extraordinary
for others. At times the striped bass and ling cod bite were the best in
memory, (except for those who remember fear and loathing giant lizards).
All this in the face of El Nino s backlash, a winter that lasted until mid-June
and a virtual blowout for the entire months of January and February. </p>

<p>The bureaucratic boys and girls who count fish, (live ones), promised
more salmon in our off-shore waters since the days of government cheese,
but weather patterns chased the bait fish hither and yon leaving a huge
population of skinny fish with bad dispositions, seemingly indisposed at
times to lick a circle hook. When the seas laid down there was pretty decent
fishing but there were days on end during Spring prime time when nary a
soul ventured out on the briny. Toward the end of the salmon season there
was a flurry of really large toads caught on the North side which somewhat
assuaged those who would say nay. Overall the catch rate was down from recent
seasons due in large part to a lack of effort. Effort is a major factor
in fishing statistics. When people opt for loading up on striped bass in
the Bay rather than bouncing about on bumpty seas trying to locate a school
of salmon . . . the salmon figures plummet as well as the public s interest
in that fishery. Were it not for the phenomenal resurgence in striped bass
from May through September, fisher folk most probably would have put up
with a bit of discomfort and caught more salmon and/or retched in the process.
</p>

<p>Following the dictates of peoples reluctance to retch, the Emeryville
Sportfishing Center s skippers began fishing the Bays early on and found
a surprisingly large amount of bait, (probably blown in through the Gate),
being chased by flotillas of big halibut and lo, and behold: schools of
striped bass! Thus began a serendipitous role reversal of bass and halibut
that lasted all spring and summer inside the Bay and along both the North
and South coasts. In recent years halibut has been the targeted specie,
but this time around, butt catches became almost incidental in this, the
year of the bass. Halibut fishing started off quite a bit earlier than usual
with a lot of August size fish caught in mid-April. By the end of May they
had become a secondary target in lieu of rampaging bass bites near the tops
of the tides. During the lulls between bass pandemonium, big halibut were
being taken by drifting the usual places. This was a case of, more water
equals more bass! Most days in late May, June and early July skippers could
count on getting limits of large stripers in an hour or less of madness
on the rocks. Two to three minute drifts over several rocks west of Alcatraz
would produce hook-ups for nearly everyone on the boat. The challenge then,
was to reel in a runaway ten to twenty pound bass through a cluster of lines
in a three to four knot current. </p>

<p>By mid-Summer the best action moved to the coves along the coast, (particularly
the North side), where triple limits were not unusual. Most days recorded
bass limits and good halibut and salmon scores to boot. The bass bite slowed
down in September just in time to allow fishers to reap a rockfish and ling
cod harvest at the Farallon Islands. Anglers were getting limits of larger-than-usual
blue, olive and yellowtail rock cod with just a few drops using shrimp flies,
or one at a time using ultra light tackle and jigs. The rest of the day
was spent tussling with ling cod or big reds, (many in the ten to twenty
pound class), that showed a penchant for mugging big sardines. More lings
were lost than caught, but adrenaline rushes were palpable for a couple
of hours during this daily fishing frenzy. </p>

<p>The past two months has seen the initiation of the vaunted rock fish-crab
combo. People loooove crab! The first week of the sport season was spectacular.
Limits of big crabs everyday to complement good catches of quality school
fish and a scattering of lings. Then the commercial guys hit the water and
crab scores drooped a bit due to pilferage, fishing pressure and the crab
s December mating fling, (wherein they would rather diddle in the sand than
scuttle into a nice wire enclosure for lunch). This crab thing is an ongoing
learning process and in the coming months will develop into a more predictable
fishery. </p>

<p>Nineteen ninety-nine will be a great year to go fishing if for no other
reason than to momentarily escape the madness from Washington and the media
millennium hype. Salmon season starts on March 27 and maybe those two-footers
that dodged your best intentions last year are now nearly three feet long
and just swimming around, looking for a place in your smoker . . . and mine.
</p>

<p>-Kim Gale The Crew That Do </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>El Nino last year, La Nina this year. What s it all mean? Customers and
crew moping round the shop, cussing today's weather and hoping the ocean
will lay down tomorrow. This is the way of winter in these parts. Though
last year s weather was horrendous, this November and early December has
been a study in gnarliness, the Crew That Do at the Emeryville Sportfishing
Center takes the day to day offerings in stride . . . except maybe for Don
(I don t like weather) Wong. Donny has been skippering folks on rock cod,
crab combos on the C-Gull II while partner Jay Yokomizo enjoyed a two week
hunting trip in Kansas. (Look out, Toto!), and is now settling into the
bonds of matrimony and then by the first of the year, back to the daily
pursuit of rock fish and dungeness crabs . . . weather permitting. </p>

<p>Captain Harry Garabedian and his New Seeker will continue to offer rock
cod and crab combinations. Both boats have found consistently excellent
fishing at the Farallons, usually getting limits for all within an hour
or two. The crab count became a bit spotty in late November due to pilferage
and the proclivities of crabs to mate rather than eat at this time of year.
The last couple of weeks have seen a decline of high sea rip-offs and the
crustaceans have begun to stop for lunch during their lusty liaisons. Limits
and near limits have been the rule. </p>

<p>The New Huck Finn with Art Roby at the helm made its last run of the
year a few weeks ago for a bouncy but productive live bait trip to the islands.
Bout the first of the year Art will begin offering sturgeon/striped bass
trips in the Bays and live bait trips to the Islands. At this writing, (the
day after Christmas) there are a flurries of interactions with Mr. Sturgie
in Bays North and South When the herring start their spawn the sturgeon
bite could really break wide open. . . particularly south of the Bay bridge.
</p>

<p>Kurt Hochberg and the able crew on the New Salmon Queen will be commercially
crabbing until readying for the salmon season opener while Mick Menigoz's
New Superfish continues taking folks out to watch critters. He will, of
course take a weekday charter in a heartbeat. Be sure to consult wintertime
shop stewards, Craig and Carl, for prognostications of sturgeon sensibilities
and haphazard long range weather predictions. -K.G.</p>

<p>July 1999 Issue</p>

<p>It s time to bid La Nina, &quot;adios!&quot; It s back to normal, maybe.
It may be cookin  in Concord but it s cool as a cucumber on the coast and
there's usually a stiff breeze by afternoon. This IS the weather for this
time year. This time of year usually finds everybody fishin  every day.
And this year is no differentThe Captain Hook with skipper Chris Smith is
going to be doing live bait potluck trips in San Francisco and San Pablo
Bays. He will sneak around the corners if necessary to fish the coves and
rocks for big butts and bass. </p>

<p>Co-captains Don Wong and Jay Yokomizo aboard the C-Gull II have, and
will continue to fish for salmon, do pot lucks in the bays and along the
beaches and do live bait rock fish and ling cod trips to the Farallons on
demand.</p>

<p>About the only thing skipper Barry Caranavo on his six pack, Fishing
Fool IV, doesn t do is rock cod. But he would if asked. Barry has been doing
well with big leopard sharks and is regularly doing bass, halibut and salmon
trips.</p>

<p> Captain Art Roby, the grizzled guru by the Bay is fishing for butts,
bass and anything else with live bait every day aboard his New Huck Finn.
Art will go anywhere to ply his potluck philosophy of trying to offer a
variety of species to his clients.</p>

<p>Kurt Hochburg continues to fish mostly for salmon this summer. The affable
Captain Kurt and his New Salmon Queen will follow this year s toads wherever
they congregate; Point Reyes Beach, the deep reef or hopefully, right out
front.</p>

<p>The New Seeker, skippered by Harry Garabedian and Ralph have been primarily
fishing for the big, beautiful salmon that are running, (swimming, actually),
around outside the Gate. Harry and Ralph will continue this line of endeavor
until it s time to do something else.</p>

<p>The big, fast New Superfish, piloted by  fish ho  Mick Menigoz does salmon
or potluck trips during the week. Weekends are spent watching whales and
other critters. Later this summer, if albacore show up, Mick will be leading
the charge to deep water.Ivan Hotz, skipper of the Rapid Transit has been
fishing for anything with a tail: particularly if they are a halibut, striped
bass or salmon. Ivan will continue his multi-specie forays throughout the
summer.                         -K.G</p>

<p><b>Halibut ARE Funny!</b></p>

<p>For a number of years this writer enjoyed and looked forward to the company
of a very senior citizen of Japanese ancestry who would, on occasion join
me in the madcap exercise of trying to catch a halibut from the Berkeley
pier. This diminutive, wizened gentleman would be a study in seriousness
as he watched his bobbers, fed line to halibut meandering away with his
shiner perch in their mouths, set the hook, and played him into a net. When
a halibut; anybody s halibut, was hoisted on deck, this good man's demeanor
turned to hysterical mirth. He would do a little dance. &quot;Ah, haha ah,a-haha,
That fish is soooo funny! Ah ha ha ahh. Eyes on one side of his head, ha
aha ha ha! Big frigging teeth! Bite you frigging finger right off. Ah, haha
ah, a-haha!&quot; This levity would pretty much continue until the halibut
was measured and either thrown back or put on a leash. My camaraderie with
this gentleman left me with a lasting impression that halibut are; in addition
to being good eating, funny.</p>

<p>Aside from being somewhat unusual looking, the halibuts  funny  mystique
may come from the fact that that the sum substance most people know about
butts is that they do taste real good. Everybodyknows, or at least has a
perception, of the habits and mores of salmon, striped bass and even rock
fish. Ask folk where halibut go in the winter and you ll get a hella bunch
of vague ideas, or in most cases, just a blank stare. Like asking why your
mother-in-law is the way she is. </p>

<p>We were able to get a few answers from Don Schultze, a senior Fish &amp;
Game biologist and glean a few factoids from a 500 page book from Fish &amp;
Game that would make sense only to marine biology methodologists. Some information
herewith came from Art Roby s decades of experience fishing for butts and
from Emeryville Sportfishing Center s very own Craig Stone who makes a point
of knowing a bit about the sexual proclivities and most other functions
of all God s local underwater critters.</p>

<p>We do know that halibut are broadcast spawners. They just up and release
their eggs and sperm into the water column. This seemingly haphazard sex
act happens mostly along the open coast but because of its size, San Francisco
Bay hosts countless acts of butt smut. Halibut larvae are either carried,
or in other ways, find their way into shallow, protected lagoons and estuaries
which appear to be vital in the first year of their lives. Studies indicate
that juveniles, (from one to two and a half years) leave these most sheltered
waters but will remain in large semi-protected bays. There is a great disparity
among young butts, particularly females, in size and sexual maturity. </p>

<p>Some males can become mature at one year where others wait until they
are nearly three years old. Perhaps the horniness of a ten inch male halibut
is much better suited to procreation without contact considering that the
object of his affection is most apt to be twice his length and many times
his weight.</p>

<p>The ever-so-funny Paralichthys Californicus settle into a relatively
unknown set of life style patterns when they reach adulthood. Males reach
legal size, (22&quot;) at an average of five years. All males are sexual
mature, (active?), by three years whereas females take at least another
year to reach puberty and are usually of legal size when they began flaunting
their eggs around and about. Some females grow to 25&quot; by their third
year and may grow to 40&quot; by the time they are ten years old. Males
rarely get that big. The largest recorded California halibut was a big mama
measuring 60&quot; and weighing 72 lbs. </p>

<p>So, we can asume that local halibut procreate right here in our bay and
their progeny find their way to protected areas before moving out into the
bays. Juveniles definitely hang here and wind up in the nets San Francisco
and San Pablo Bay shrimpers. When asked where halibut go when they are not
in the Bays, (that is, from late October through Match), Craig, the Sportfishing
Center s owner-operator took an officious stance, &quot;I don t know. Nobody
knows. Probably way out.&quot; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MORE FUNNY BUSINESS</p>

<p>It s been a strange year to date. The wind blew so hard this spring that
trips in the Bay had to be cancelled. The ocean was frigid in April and
May and is just now warming up to snuff. A slow salmon bite this spring
was blamed by many on the cold water. But then, why do the same fish go
on feeding frenzies in Alaskan 38o water? Recently there have been some
days where the bite has been almost wide open but then the next day folks
have to scratch to get a salmon a rod. The salmon however, have been as
big, as red and generally as beautiful as anyone can remember. </p>

<p>Halibut fishing in June has been decent some days, spotty on others.
The stripers have moving into San Francisco Bay more slowly than last year
but at this writing, party boats are starting to see limits of stripers
taken off the rockpiles around the bay.</p>

<p>Next issue we ll take a look at perceived and real dangers from eating
fish caught in the San Francisco Bay system. Preliminary data from the San
Francisco Estuary Institure indicates that there may be some risk in stuffing
oneself daily with real large bass, particularly if one does not trim the
red meat from the fillets. Smaller bass, halibut and sturgeon seem to have
levels of mercury and other chemicals in their white fillets that may be
of little concern to most fisherfolk.Weird weather the last two years has
had an impact on the fishing. Some good. Some. . . well, it s a funny business.
A final halibut thought: if butts fought in the water like they do on land
our Bay would be awash in human exotica flown in to hook up with a manhole
cover gone amuck.                                            -Kim Gale</p>

<p>1 tsp. dried crushed thyme.</p>

<p>1 tsp. cayenne pepper.</p>

<p>1 tsp. finely ground black pepper.</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. ground white pepper.</p>

<p>2 tsp. salt, (optional).</p>

<p>Melt butter and brush on each side of steak or fillet.  Mix all the spices
together, sprinkle generously on each side and pat on mixture by hand. 
Heat a large frying over medium-high heat and put about one tablespoon of
butter per piece of fish in pan.  When butter is really hot, (just before
it turns brown), place the fish in the pan.  Fry until very brown, (2 to
3 minutes), turn and repeat other side.  Serve fish immediately.  This is
delicious dipped in melted butter if your chlesterol count can handle it</p>

<p><b>Hot Halibut Salad  from Kim Gale</b></p>

<p>Most of the ingredients of this salad are arbitrary and can be substituted
with vegetables or food stuffs that reflect the individual s taste.  The
feature of this salad is that of hot fish and cool vegetables combining
for really neat taste sensation.</p>

<p>One half pound halibut fillet.</p>

<p>3 tbl. soy sauce.</p>

<p>3 tbl. olive oil.</p>

<p>1 tbl. Chinese hot pepper oil.</p>

<p>1/4 cup of Contadina bread crumbs.</p>

<p>Eight to ten leaves of romaine lettuce.</p>

<p>One large tomato cut into wedges.</p>

<p>Ten or twelve thin slices each of daikon radish and zucchini.</p>

<p>One small yellow or red onion, thinly sliced.</p>

<p>One clove of garlic, sliced.</p>

<p>One half small green or red sweet pepper, sliced.</p>

<p>Two or three ounces of feta cheese.</p>

<p>Salad dressing to taste.An hour before dinner, cut the halibut fillets
into bite size cubes and marinate with a mixture of the soy sauce and the
and the hot pepper oil.  Place in refrigerator.  In two large salad bowls
place hand shredded romaine lettuce leaves and the rest of the veggies in
whatever pattern you like.  Crumble your feta and arrange tomato wedges
on top before placing in fridge.  Fifteen minutes before eating, take marinated
fish from fridge and pour out excess fluid.  Heat olive oil in large skillet
at high heat.  Put bread crumbs on a plate and roll fish cubes in crumbs
until well crumbed.  Put a bit of salt into the hot olive oil to keep it
from popping When the oil is really hot, put crumbed fish cubes on to fry.
 Lay out several paper towels and get the salads out of the fridge.  After
about two minutes of frying, gingerly turn the fish cubes with a spatula
and cook for another minute, minute and a half or so.  Place the fish on
the napkins until excess oil is gone then put fish cubes on salad, add dressing
and serve.  Note: goopy cheese, ranch or French dressings do not work very
well here  Try an Italian dressing or vinaigrette  of your own invention.</p>

<p><b><font size="+1">6th Annual Kids Issue</font></b></p>

<p>Johnny, Get Your Rod!</p>

<p>Johnny s long lost fascination with the end of the old Berkeley pier,
the  ho-hum  cantilevered section of the Bay Bridge, the nothing-to-look-at
northern tip of Treasure Island, the half-eaten cheese sandwich and anything
else boring are swept away in a wide eyed reaction of a youngster watching
his rod tip disappear beneath the railing toward Tibet. A ferocious frown
and gritted teeth mask the excitement and wonder that all but blots out
shouts and admonitions, &quot;reel! reel! reel! fish on! keep your tip up!
you got him!&quot; The squintiness of battle changes to wide eyed wonder
as the fish is brought to net. The strut and smile as congratulations are
offered is sunshine on a leaden day. </p>

<p>Although the little kid, big fish scenario will be commonplace this summer
and throughout the year, a parent can take steps and precautions that will
better the chances of a really fun party boat fishing trip with their progeny.
Laissez faire, (read: laid back), is probably the key attitude to successfully
introducing your kids to fishing. Talking up great or unreal expectations
on that first trip can only lead to disappointment and delusion: given your
youngster s rampant imagination. </p>

<p>Introducing your children to your pastime, avocation, or hobby should
be one of parenting s primordial blessings. In today s wonderful new world,
your progeny s reaction to this attempt at bonding is, as often as not,
&quot;daaaad!, (or maawm!) this sucks, big-time!&quot; Now, we would not
presume to tout fishing as an answer to all such youthful diffidence but
it is our conviction that most kids, (boys and girls, alike) really like
the idea of catching a fish.</p>

<p>New Huck Finn skipper Art Roby offered a few suggestions gleaned from
eons of angler cheerleading and kiddie coaching. &quot;Keep em warm!&quot;
Be aware that damn near every morning it is frigid on the Bay and Ocean
until a couple of hours after sunrise and that on the coast, more days than
not there is fog, not sunshine, until after noon. Art went on to extol hand-held
games. &quot;Bring something for the kids to do when the fishing slows down
or during long moves.&quot; Art, and the other skippers at the harbor spend
a lot of effort to insure that their younger clients savor their trip. Let
your kid(s) have the run of the ship and emphasize to them the other wonderful
aspects of fishing; the great outdoors, looking for landmarks, birds and
other marine life. As an introduction, take your youngster to a pond loaded
with pan fish, or target bull-heads, jack smelt and king fish at one of
the Bay 's piers and let the kiddo get familiar with handling a rod  n reel.
If the fish aren t biting, leave before it becomes an ordeal. Try it again
another day.</p>

<p>To cultivate a kid s interest in actually going fishing and wanting to
learn how to catch fish takes a bit of foresight and planning. Rather than
souring your nipper s fish lust beside a dead lake in one-hundred degree
heat or foisting him off on Grandpa s four hour odyssey to beyond-the-Farallons
with twenty other grumpy old guys, plan the trip around the whims and capabilities
of the kid(s).</p>

<p>Summer weather, being the crap-shoot it is, begs one to consider fishing
in the Bay the first time out. Potluck fishing on the Bay and around the
Gate lessens the chance of funny tummies and affords a real good chance
at a bass or halibut. On the other hand, much of the salmon mooching from
now on will be fairly close to shore. One thing not to do is dwell on the
possibilities or consequences of being sick. Once the fishing starts your
worries are pretty much over, and the way fishing has been this summer,
you and your kid(s) are going to have your hands full wrestling with rampaging
bass, salmon and halibut or a combination of two or three of the species.
</p>

<p>A few considerations such as a good night s sleep, a low grease factor
in the evening and morning s food intake, avoidance of hot chocolate with
milk will work to lower the chance of hurling for both kids and first-timer
parents. Munching a bunch of crackers or chips is also a good way to foil
the quesies. Anti-emetics, (Dramamine), work for most people if taken the
night before and upon wakening. Most of these concoctions cause drowsiness,
so follow the label s instructions.</p>

<p>A final important plea from skippers and crew is to realize that they
are not baby sitters. They will give extra fishy attention to kids, but
they don t have time to brush up on their parenting skills.Most everyone
agreed that, kids in pairs, be they peers or friends, have a better chance
of insuring themselves a real fun fishing experience . . . and at half price
fares for those twelve and under, it s a hella better deal than a few hours
of standing in lines at an amusement park for the same amount of money.
The  crew that do  at the Emeryville Sportfishing Center stands ready to
answer any questions you might have about setting up a wonderful day fishing
the bounding main with your children. -                  Kim  Gale</p>

<p>HOW TO GET KIDS TO EAT FISH</p>

<p>&quot;Gross!&quot;  &quot;This sucks, big time!&quot;  &quot;I ll just
hurl all over the place.&quot;  &quot;I d rather die!&quot;  These, and
other oaths that cannot be printed in a fishy publication, are the usual
comments from kids when confronted by a lovely piece of poached halibut
topped with a bit of tasty creamed lemon egg sauce.</p>

<p>So, what do you do to get the nippers eating healthy when you ve got
enough fish in the freezer to feed the family twice a week for the rest
of the year?  Well, most likely, it s gonna take a bit of extra time in
the kitchen.  It s worth it to save the earth s atmosphere from eventually
becoming one big cow fart, or watching your progeny keel over at an early
age from clogged arteries, isn t it?  Last year this writer got on the phone
plaguing kith and kin with a real no-brainer, &quot;how do you cook fish
so kids will eat it?&quot;  Most of response ranged from, &quot;make it
look like a french fry&quot; to &quot;lie to little bugger and tell him
it s chicken.&quot;There were few rays of hope shed on the subject.  From
down-east brother: &quot;slip it in spaghetti parmesan&quot;, and, &quot;most
kids will eat fish chowder if it has a lot of butter in it.&quot;  And then:
&quot;kids like tarter sauce, so: it s tarter sauce and fish sticks.&quot;
 My five year old granddaughter loves poached salmon with a tarragon and
white wine sauce. Yeah, right!  She comes from a fishy family, indeed. 
From another family corner: &quot;fried calamari! Kid s like to clean the
squid . . . it s educational?&quot; and then there was, &quot;my son will
eat barbecued fish, if it s overcooked&quot;.So there you go.  Kids will
eat fish . . . if it s cooked and served in as unhealthy and unpalatable
a manner as possible.  Or, &quot;you don t like your steamed rock cod with
hot garlic sauce?  Well, have some more nice vegetables.&quot;  This response
might well set the psychic ball rolling toward a horrendous crime in 2019,
but maybe it s worth the risk.</p>

<p><b>GOOD EATS </b></p>

<p>Four salmon faves from the Emeryville Sportfishing Center Cookbook. Poached
Salmon from Kurt Hochburg 1 to 1-1/2 lbs. salmon steaks or fillets, (with
or without skin). 1/3 cup heavy cream. 1/3 cup white wine, (Johannesburg
Riesling would be nice). 2 tbl. chopped shallots. 1/4 tsp. garlic salt.
1/2 stick sweet butter. 1/2 tsp. dill weed. Melt butter in 8 to 10 covered
frying pan or wok at low heat. Add the cream and then the wine. Stir thoroughly,
(but slowly) as you add the shallots, dill weed and garlic salt. Lay fillets
or steaks in sauce. Cover and cook for 15 minutes at medium heat. Do not
overcook. Kurt is the owner and skipper of the New Salmon Queen. It seems

<p><b>Salmon Cakes</b> from Kim Gale</p>

<p>Use the belly meat from two medium salmon or from one big ole slug. Be
sure to cut around pectoral ins and stomach bones. Some of the white skin
can be left on meat. 1 Large Potato. 1 egg. 1 medium to large onion. 1/2
cup crushed crackers. 1/4 cup bread crumbs. 2 garlic cloves. Use salt, pepper
dill weed and chopped sweet basil to taste. Finely chop salmon, potato,
onion and garlic. (Food chopper recommended.) Stir in crackers, bread crumbs,
egg and seasonings. Make eight to ten patties from this mess. If it gets
too gloopy, add more crackers or bread crumbs. Fry patties til brown on
both sides over medium high heat in olive or the vegetable oil of your choice,
Served with baked beans, maybe. The Maritime French Canadians make a pie
of this mixture. Just put the glop, less crackers in a pie crust and bake
at 350o for 45 minutes. Lemon juice and a bit of catsup or hot sauce work
well on the cakes or the pie. Kim is a graphic artist, crab cooker and writer
suffering from late onset fishiness.</p>

<p><b>Salmon Quiche</b> from Barbara Barnard</p>

<p>1 Pillsbury pie crust (from the refridge section of your market). 1 pint
of sour cream. 4 eggs. 1/2 to 1 lb. salmon steak, precooked, (poached),
boned and flaked. 8 oz. of shredded cheddar cheese. 1 tsp. lemon pepper.
And then . . . Form pie crust into a quiche pan. Blend eggs and sour cream
until smooth. Add salmon, cheese and lemon pepper, stirring until well blended.
Pour mixture into the crust-lined quiche pan and bake at 325o for 45 minutes
to an hour until top is lightly browned. Cool at least 15 minutes and serve
warm. Makes 12 servings or so, or one big ol pigout for grumpy old gourmands.

<p>2 ripe tomatoes.</p>

<p>1 onion, (red or white).</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. pepper.</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. powdered thyme.</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. garlic powder.</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. oregano powder.</p>

<p>Slice the tomato and onion. Place half the tomato and onion slices in

pepper, oregano and thyme to taste. Place the remaining onions and tomato
on top of seasoned fish, cover with aluminum foil and place in pre-heated
350o oven for roughly 15 minutes, (depending on the thickness of the fillets).
Good with rice or pasta.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Steamed Rock Cod with Hot Black Bean Sauce.</b></p>

<p>from Craig Stone</p>

<p>You'll need a 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 lb. fresh rock fish, gutted, gilled and
scaled. Vermillion, bolinas, china, golden eye, chucklehead or fantail rock
fish are the most prized species for this recipe.</p>

<p>1 fish, (with or without head).</p>

<p>3 or 4 stalks of green onion.</p>

<p>2 or 3 tbl. salted black beans.</p>

<p>2 slices of shredded ginger root.</p>

<p>1 tbl. minced garlic.</p>

<p>1 tsp. soy sauce.</p>

<p>1 tsp. sesame oil.</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. salt.</p>

<p>1/4 to 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper.</p>

<p>Dry the whole fish with a paper towel and sprinkle with salt. Then combine
beans, ginger, garlic, and pepper and mash into a paste. Thoroughly mix
this unctuous looking, great smelling goop into the oil and soy sauce. Carefully
rub fish's body with this mixture. No sense wasting the paste on the head
unless you're going to eat it, or your cat has a perverse hankering for
hot stuff. Place the green onion on top of the fish in a steamer and cook
for 10 to 15 minutes depending on the size of the fish.</p>

<p><b>Whole Barbequed Spicy Rock Cod from Art Roby</b></p>

<p>2 whole rock fish, (blues, olives or reds,) scaled, gutted and be-headed.</p>

<p>The sauce:</p>

<p>1/4 cup soy sauce.</p>

<p>1 tbl. hot chili oil.</p>

<p>1-1/2 tsp. crushed ginger.</p>

<p>1 tsp sesame oil.</p>

<p>1-1/2 tsp. crushed garlic.</p>

<p>1 tsp. peanut oil.Mix ingredients well to make sauce, then marinade fish
two to four hours. Score skin of fish at an angle 3 or 4 times on each side.
Move from the middle to the outer edge of barbeque grill after skin has
been browned crisp or blackened. Let cook for another 10 minutes. Baste
occasionally during process.</p>

<p><b><font size="+2">No Ling Cod Next Year?</font></b></p>

<p>It's Up To You</p>

<p>At a recent week-long meeting of the Pacific Fishery Management Council
in Sacramento, folks weighed options to save an allegedly endangered ling
cod fishery. Unfortunately it seems that the council has lumped the entire
Pacific Coast together when considering this one fishery. Ling cod have
been rare in Southern California since Hector was a pup and recently, the
ling population along the coasts of Oregon and Washington have been ravaged
by commercial enterprises determined to market anything that swims. The
ling cod of Central and Northern California are, by and large, thriving.
Party boats and skiffs targeting lings have seen no decline in recent years.
The main depredations have come from the commercial</p>

<p>guys who are not working with any size restrictions. The ling cod fishing
at Cordell Banks and the Farallon Islands seems to be better now than it
has in many years and should continue to improve with the new size and quantity
restrictions in place since the first of the year.</p>

<p>The most severe of the options being considered for passage by the council
at the next meeting in early November is a total ban on the taking of ling
cod: anywhere, any time. Other options include a seven month season, limited
size windows, (i.e.: 24&quot; to 34&quot; only) or one-a-day limits.</p>

<p>In order to avoid an unwarranted end to fishing for ling cod it is essential
that you, the fisher folk, make your views known to the Council before the
first of November. Facts and figures are the fodder these folks feed on,

<p align="CENTER"><b><font color="#780712" size="+2">Salmon the Same Old, Same
Old</font></b></p>

<p>By Kim Gale 3-24-99</p>

<p> In a five day marathon of marine biologist s projections, predictions,
predilections and resultant fidgety boredom, the advisory committee has
suggested nary a change in its recommendation to the National Marine Fisheries
Service. This would not prevent that august body however, from dropping
a regulatory bomb on the salmon season in mid-April but according to committee
member Craig Stone, owner-manager of the Emeryville Sportfishing Center
and spoiler of animals, that would be, damn unlikely. </p>

<p>Craig and New Salmon Queen skipper Kurt Hochburg returned from their
annual fun fest in Portland last week bored to tears but feeling like the
do-right boys of the deep . So, we will be using the circle hook for mooching
and keeping no salmon less than 24 from March 27 to July 1 and from the
first of September til season s end on Halloween. During July and August
you ll go home with the first two fish you catch regardless of size. The
Bay Area fisher's big day of the year is right around the corner and at
this writing things look pretty encouraging for the salmon opener. The weather
seems to be following a kinder, gentler pattern than El Nino s day-after-day
blowouts and there is a lot more bait in a colder, more settled ocean. Nearly
every rock fish trip to the Farallons the last few weeks has seen incidental
hooking of nice, fat salmon. </p>

<p>The weather did turn gnarly on the second day of the season for Pigeon
Point, South to nether regions. Scores were low but a couple of boats blundered
into big bait balls and rewarded those who didn t set their circle hooks
with pudgy ten pound fish. The despised circle hook is here to stay as long
as the powers that be are concerned with saving the Winter and Spring salmon
runs and as long as men will mooch. It seems, that in most cases a salmon
will not swallow a circle hook, thus affording itself a much better chance
of surviving after being hooked and released. </p>

<p>The Dept. of Fish &amp; Game has estimated that there are currently about
800,000 adult salmon swimming about in California Coastal waters. This annual
projection is somewhat above an average census that is usually underestimated.
Last year however, the DFG calculated that more than a million salmon in
our neighborhood were looking to get laid but only about half that number
were accounted for by the end of the year. The commercial guys caught about
200,000 fish. Sport fishers caught a little over 100,000 and slightly more
than 200,000 were counted doing the spawning thing. This means at least
a half million salmon starved to death, were eaten by sea lions or successfully
hid from folks who would count fish. </p>

<p>The fall salmon run is what California s commercial and sport fishery
is all about. Incidental Winter and Spring runs of smaller salmon, (no more
than 20,000 at their peak) became scarce during the eighties due to lumber
and agriculture water transgressions. The winter run fish became damn near
extinct several years ago. The National Marine Fishery Service decided it
incumbent to save these rag-tag, pint sized cousins from being finished
off by sea lions. They have spent mucho millions of dollars ditzing around
Shasta Dam to insure correct Spring spawning temperatures and instituted
the spate of salmon fishing regulations that we fish by today. </p>

<p>From an estimated low of one hundred and fifty fish in 1995, the winter
run has reportedly increased to well over a thousand at this juncture. This
run will be restored when and if it reaches the 10,000 level. It should
be pointed out that looking for these small winter run fish frolicking in
five feet of muddy water yields a somewhat less accurate count than that
of their big bouncy cousins that squirrel around in the Autumn shallows.
Since a majority of the Winter and Spring run salmon are less than 24 inches
long the current length limit gives these fish a better chance to survive
so they can be not counted while propagating later on. The preservation
of these fish is the reason the salmon season openers have been moved from
mid February to the end of March. In July and August the threatened cousins
allegedly refrain from cruising our coast. Why then can t we mooch with
J-hooks and jerk our rods in a manly fashion during July and August. Who
knows? -Kim Gale </p>

<p>THE CREW THAT DO Happier days here in harmony harbor. Weather has been
allowing trips two, three, even four days a week and the salmon opener is
right around the corner. Inspections have been passed, hulls cleaned, blotches
painted over. Were ready to go. As for any kind of set schedule based on
prognosis, there s not! The skippers, the deckhands, the folks behind the
counter, i.e.: the crew that do will take advantage of weather, whereabouts
of fish and their proclivity toward giving it up and of course, the whims
of their clients: to explore and exploit any option. </p>

<p>March 27th will find everyone mooching for salmon. The C-Gull II with
captains Don Wong and Jay Yokomizo and Becka the blond bombshell in the
wheel house will continue fishing for salmon into April as will captain
Harry Garabedian s New Seeker with Ralph at the controls. Both boats will
be available to do rockfish and crab combo trips on demand. </p>

<p>Look for skipper Kurt Hochberg on the New Salmon Queen to mooch for salmon
until something better happens. Former roller derby ace and skipper emeritus
Art Roby starts fishing for salmon aboard his New Huck Finn but will begin
patrolling the Bays for halibut and striped bass with live bait somewhere
around the middle of April. Fish ho Mick Menigoz will watch whales on weekends
but will fish for anything that bites during the week while skippering his
big, fast Super Fish. The very well rounded captain Ivan Hotz becomes a
regular pillar of the Emeryville Sportfishing Center skipper s fraternity
on the rapid Rapid Transit. Chris Smith will putt-put down from Crockett
at the helm of the Captain Hook in mid-April to join the fishing for butts
n bass. A bit later in April Barry Caranavo brings his six-pack, Fishing
Fool IV to grace the harbor. Barry will fish for anything you want and will
get you there in a real hurry. -K.G. </p>

too gloopy, add more crackers or bread crumbs. Fry patties til brown on
both sides over medium high heat in olive or the vegetable oil of your choice,
Served with baked beans, maybe. The Maritime French Canadians make a pie
of this mixture. Just put the glop, less crackers in a pie crust and bake
at 350o for 45 minutes. Lemon juice and a bit of catsup or hot sauce work
well on the cakes or the pie. Kim is a graphic artist, crab cooker and writer

pepper, oregano and thyme to taste. Place the remaining onions and tomato
on top of seasoned fish, cover with aluminum foil and place in pre-heated
350o oven for roughly 15 minutes, (depending on the thickness of the fillets).
Good with rice or pasta.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Steamed Rock Cod with Hot Black Bean Sauce.</b></p>

<p>from Craig Stone</p>

<p>You'll need a 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 lb. fresh rock fish, gutted, gilled and
scaled. Vermillion, bolinas, china, golden eye, chucklehead or fantail rock
fish are the most prized species for this recipe.</p>

<p>1 fish, (with or without head).</p>

<p>3 or 4 stalks of green onion.</p>

<p>2 or 3 tbl. salted black beans.</p>

<p>2 slices of shredded ginger root.</p>

<p>1 tbl. minced garlic.</p>

<p>1 tsp. soy sauce.</p>

<p>1 tsp. sesame oil.</p>

<p>1/2 tsp. salt.</p>

<p>1/4 to 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper.</p>

<p>Dry the whole fish with a paper towel and sprinkle with salt. Then combine
beans, ginger, garlic, and pepper and mash into a paste. Thoroughly mix
this unctuous looking, great smelling goop into the oil and soy sauce. Carefully
rub fish's body with this mixture. No sense wasting the paste on the head
unless you're going to eat it, or your cat has a perverse hankering for
hot stuff. Place the green onion on top of the fish in a steamer and cook
for 10 to 15 minutes depending on the size of the fish.</p>

<p><b>Whole Barbequed Spicy Rock Cod from Art Roby</b></p>

<p>2 whole rock fish, (blues, olives or reds,) scaled, gutted and be-headed.</p>

<p>1-1/2 tsp. crushed ginger.</p>

<p>1 tsp sesame oil.</p>

<p>1-1/2 tsp. crushed garlic.</p>

<p>1 tsp. peanut oil.Mix ingredients well to make sauce, then marinade fish
two to four hours. Score skin of fish at an angle 3 or 4 times on each side.
Move from the middle to the outer edge of barbeque grill after skin has
been browned crisp or blackened. Let cook for another 10 minutes. Baste
occasionally during process.</p>

<p><b><font size="+2">No Ling Cod Next Year?</font></b></p>

<p>It's Up To You</p>

<p>At a recent week-long meeting of the Pacific Fishery Management Council
in Sacramento, folks weighed options to save an allegedly endangered ling
cod fishery. Unfortunately it seems that the council has lumped the entire
Pacific Coast together when considering this one fishery. Ling cod have
been rare in Southern California since Hector was a pup and recently, the
ling population along the coasts of Oregon and Washington have been ravaged
by commercial enterprises determined to market anything that swims. The
ling cod of Central and Northern California are, by and large, thriving.
Party boats and skiffs targeting lings have seen no decline in recent years.
The main depredations have come from the commercial</p>

<p>guys who are not working with any size restrictions. The ling cod fishing
at Cordell Banks and the Farallon Islands seems to be better now than it
has in many years and should continue to improve with the new size and quantity
restrictions in place since the first of the year.</p>

<p>The most severe of the options being considered for passage by the council
at the next meeting in early November is a total ban on the taking of ling
cod: anywhere, any time. Other options include a seven month season, limited
size windows, (i.e.: 24&quot; to 34&quot; only) or one-a-day limits.</p>

<p>In order to avoid an unwarranted end to fishing for ling cod it is essential
that you, the fisher folk, make your views known to the Council before the
first of November. Facts and figures are the fodder these folks feed on,

Put A Big One In The Smoker There has never<img height="400" width="173" src="/web/20000817090301im_/http://usafishing.com:80/A-ImagesSalmonOcean/Kimsalmon.jpg" align="right"> been a better time than right now to catch a truly large  salmon. Forget Alaska ! Forget British Columbia! They&Mac226;re here! This year's  salmon catch to date has seen the largest fish in memory starting with that  first fish that thunked the box back in late March. </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">The cold Spring and  Summer has kept the ocean flush with enormous schools anchovies and sardines..  Salmon as big as your grandmother are getting fatter every day as they lumber  around the coves and beaches near the Golden Gate gorging themselves silly  before making their trek toward sexual satisfaction and fishy redemption in  the Sierra foothills. Craig Stone, the force from behind the counter at the Emeryville Sportfishing  Center has never been this excited about something that didn't have fur on it  or couldn't be hit with a sand wedge. &quot;The salmon fishing this year is just  phenomenal! For the two months the fish have averaged a solid fifteen pounds..  Many days there are more fish over twenty pounds than not.&quot; Craig conjectures  that El Nino may have a lot to do with this bonanza. &quot;Anchovies were scarce in last year's warm water. The salmon were skinny and  a lot of them starved to death. Of those who survived, many chose to spend an  extra year in the ocean putting off a rough run upriver to become raccoon food. They fortuitously hung around for this year's colder-than-average water  and larger lunches. Now we're seeing a lot of very big fish getting bigger. I think we can look forward to a lot of forty pounders later this season and a  real chance of seeing some fifty-pound plus salmon dredged up in August,  September and October.&quot; There have been very few shakers this season so when folks fret about the  limit change in August when they'll get to keep their first two fish, one can  only suggest, &quot;get a grip!&quot; There have been very few shakers to date. Why  would one fear a problem of little fish in August?<br>

                        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">It's consensus that this year's salmon are indeed a feisty bunch. The wimps  of year's past are now leading folks on a merry stumble several times &#140;round  the boat and then three, four, five deep dives before giving it up to the  smoker. Last year's salmon were dinged by El Nino and, by and large, were  small, tired fish. This time around there has been bait galore and fish that  avoided sex and starvation fed like banshees all winter and are now the  biggest salmon ever to be seen in this neck of the woods.<br>
                        </font></p>

Most fish caught on  this much maligned device are hooked on the lip rather than in the gut or  gill. Would you put up much of a fight after your esophagus or lungs were  torn to shit? It's common knowledge that gut-hooked marlin are wusses  compared to those lip hooked who then reward the angler with tail walks,  spectacular leaps and a much longer, more vigorous fight. Why would salmon be much different? A healthy lip-hooked salmon fulfills the  lore and legend of a once renowned fighting fish. Sure, people are losing a  lot of salmon because they forget or refuse to employ the techniques that  will produce hookups and once hooked up, folks are finding fish that are  better able to take advantage of an angler's miscues. The trade off of giving up jerking your rod in exchange for a fifteen-minute  battle with a fit fish is a no brainer. The key is, Leave your rod in the  holder unless you really feel the need to work your gear. Talk about this  need with your deckhand. Now, once the tip has disappeared under the gunnel  and stayed there, then it's time to start crankin' and get set for a frenzied  fight.<br>
                        <br>
                        More fodder for a fishy midsummer's night dream. Striped bass took a little  longer to go on a tear than last year. The last week has seen near solid  limits of good-eating sized stripers, (5 to 10 lbs). These fish should stay  around at least until September when the 'Crew That Do' will start focusing  on ling cod trips to the Farallons. Last year's ling cod bite was the stuff  of legends. With a two fish, 24&quot; limit in place this year, one probably does  not have to worry that this fishery is getting too much pressure. Rockfish  have generally been bigger than in recent years which points to some very  special fishing trips this fall.<br>

The action has been hot and  cold but compared to seven, ten, twelve years ago the butt fishing has been  great. There will still be a lot of big halibut caught after pot-luckers have  limited out on bass in the coming month. And then there are the vaunted crab combo trips starting in early November.  Both the C-Gull II and the New Seeker will be picking up limits of big  dungeness crabs to go along with limits of rockfish the first few weeks of  the season. The crab count tends to flatten out a bit as we get into the  teeth of winter, so now is the time to reserve your space for an early season  combo trip.                                         <br>

                        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">Some folks, for reasons of heredity or the love of spitting fish bones, will  instinctively cut up a salmon into steaks.  This is not say that barbecued or  broiled salmon steaks are pass&eacute;, but by filleting your fish, you&Mac226;ll get to  eat more of it and in an infinitely greater number of ways.  Plus, you'll  bypass the little bones between your teeth or under your plate.  Filleting a  salmon is an easy thing.  Cut behind the collar to the backbone, then along  the backbone to the tail.  Save the stomach meat for salmon burger or loaf  and don&Mac226;t forget the meat along the backbone that can be easily shaved off to  be lightly fried with scrambled eggs and chives.  Your salmon fillet can be  easily boned with a small plier before or after being poached, steamed,  baked, broiled, grilled or smoked. <br>

                        July 1, 1999 Johnny, Get Your Rod! Johnny's long lost fascination with the end of the old Berkeley pier, the  &#140;ho-hum&Mac226; cantilevered section of the Bay Bridge, the nothing-to-look-at  northern tip of Treasure Island, the half-eaten cheese sandwich and anything  else boring are swept away in a wide eyed reaction of a youngster watching  his rod tip disappear beneath the railing toward Tibet. A ferocious frown and  gritted teeth mask the excitement and wonder that all but blots out shouts  and admonitions, &quot;reel! reel! reel! fish on! keep your tip up! you got him!&quot;  The squintiness of battle changes to wide eyed wonder as the <img height="265" width="327" src="/web/20000817090301im_/http://usafishing.com:80/A-ImagesSalmonOcean/salmon52lb.jpg" align="left">fish is brought  to net. The strut and smile as congratulations are offered is sunshine on a  leaden day.  Although the little kid, big fish scenario will be commonplace this summer  and throughout the year, a parent can take steps and precautions that will  better the chances of a really fun party boat fishing trip with their  progeny. Laissez faire, (read: laid back), is probably the key attitude to  successfully introducing your kids to fishing. Talking up great or unreal  expectations on that first trip can only lead to disappointment and delusion:  given your youngster's rampant imagination.  Introducing your children to your pastime, avocation, or hobby should be one  of parenting's primordial blessings. In today's wonderful new world, your  progeny's reaction to this attempt at bonding is, as often as not, &quot;daaaad!,  (or maawm!) this sucks, big-time!&quot; Now, we would not presume to tout fishing  as an answer to all such youthful diffidence but it is our conviction that  most kids, (boys and girls, alike) really like the idea of catching a fish. New Huck Finn skipper Art Roby offered a few suggestions gleaned from eons of  angler cheerleading and kiddie coaching. &quot;Keep em warm!&quot; Be aware that damn  near every morning it is frigid on the Bay and Ocean until a couple of hours  after sunrise and that on the coast, more days than not there is fog, not  sunshine, until after noon. Art went on to extol hand-held games. &quot;Bring  something for the kids to do when the fishing slows down or during long  moves.&quot; Art, and the other skippers at the harbor spend a lot of effort to  insure that their younger clients savor their trip. Let your kid(s) have the  run of the ship and emphasize to them the other wonderful aspects of fishing;  the great outdoors, looking for landmarks, birds and other marine life. As an introduction, take your youngster to a pond loaded with pan fish, or  target bull-heads, jack smelt and king fish at one of the Bay's piers and let  the kiddo get familiar with handling a rod &#140;n reel. If the fish aren&Mac226;t  biting, leave before it becomes an ordeal. Try it again another day. To cultivate a kid's interest in actually going fishing and wanting to learn  how to catch fish takes a bit of foresight and planning. Rather than souring  your nipper's fish lust beside a dead lake in one-hundred degree heat or  foisting him off on Grandpa's four hour odyssey to beyond-the-Farallons with  twenty other grumpy old guys, plan the trip around the whims and capabilities  of the kid(s). Summer weather, being the crap-shoot it is, begs one to consider fishing in  the Bay the first time out. Potluck fishing on the Bay and around the Gate  lessens the chance of funny tummies and affords a real good chance at a bass  or halibut. On the other hand, much of the salmon mooching from now on will  be fairly close to shore. One thing not to do is dwell on the possibilities  or consequences of being sick. </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">Once the fishing starts your worries are  pretty much over, and the way fishing has been this summer, you and your  kid(s) are going to have your hands full wrestling with rampaging bass,  salmon and halibut or a combination of two or three of the species.  A few considerations such as a good night's sleep, a low grease factor in the  evening and morning's food intake, avoidance of hot chocolate with milk will  work to lower the chance of hurling for both kids and first-timer parents.  Munching a bunch of crackers or chips is also a good way to foil the quesies..  Anti-emetics, (Dramamine), work for most people if taken the night before and  upon wakening. Most of these concoctions cause drowsiness, so follow the  label's instructions. A final important plea from skippers and crew is to realize that they are not  baby sitters. They will give extra fishy attention to kids, but they don&Mac226;t  have time to brush up on their parenting skills. Most everyone agreed that, kids in pairs, be they peers or friends, have a  better chance of insuring themselves a real fun fishing experience . . . and  at half price fares for those twelve and under, it's a hella better deal than  a few hours of standing in lines at an amusement park for the same amount of  money. The &#140;crew that do&Mac226; at the Emeryville Sportfishing Center stands ready  to answer any questions you might have about setting up a wonderful day  fishing the bounding main with your children. -                  Kim  Gale    <br>

For a number of years this writer enjoyed and looked forward to the company  of a very senior citizen of Japanese ancestry who would, on occasion join me  in the madcap exercise of trying to catch a halibut from the Berkeley pier.  This diminutive, wizened gentleman would be a study in seriousness as he  watched his bobbers, fed line to halibut meandering away with his shiner  perch in their mouths, set the hook, and played him into a net. When a  halibut; anybody's halibut, was hoisted on deck, this good man's demeanor  turned to hysterical mirth. He would do a little dance. &quot;Ah, haha ah,a-haha,  That fish is soooo funny! Ah ha ha ahh. Eyes on one side of his head, ha aha  ha ha! Big frigging teeth! Bite you frigging finger right off. Ah, haha ah,  a-haha!&quot; This levity would pretty much continue until the halibut was  measured and either thrown back or put on a leash. My camaraderie with this  gentleman left me with a lasting impression that halibut are; in addition to  being good eating, funny. Aside from being somewhat unusual looking, the halibut's &#140;funny&Mac226; mystique may  come from the fact that that the sum substance most people know about butts  is that they do taste real good. Everybody knows, or at least has a  perception, of the habits and mores of salmon, striped bass and even rock  fish. Ask folk where halibut go in the winter and you&Mac226;ll get a hella bunch of  vague ideas, or in most cases, just a blank stare. Like asking why your  mother-in-law is the way she is.  We were able to get a few answers from Don Schultze, a senior Fish &amp; Game  biologist and glean a few factoids from a 500 page book from Fish &amp; Game that  would make sense only to marine biology methodologists. Some information  herewith came from Art Roby's decades of experience fishing for butts and  from Emeryville Sportfishing Center's very own Craig Stone who makes a point  of knowing a bit about the sexual proclivities and most other functions of  all God's local underwater critters. We do know that halibut are broadcast spawners. They just up and release  their eggs and sperm into the water column. This seemingly haphazard sex act  happens mostly along the open coast but because of its size, San Francisco  Bay hosts countless acts of butt smut. Halibut larvae are either carried, or  in other ways, find their way into shallow, protected lagoons and estuaries  which appear to be vital in the first year of their lives. Studies indicate  that juveniles, (from one to two and a half years) leave these most sheltered  waters but will remain in large semi-protected bays. There is a great  disparity among young butts, particularly females, in size and sexual  maturity. Some males can become mature at one year where others wait until  they are nearly three years old. Perhaps the horniness of a ten inch male  halibut is much better suited to procreation without contact considering that  the object of his affection is most apt to be twice his length and many times  his weight. The ever-so-funny Paralichthys Californicus settle into a relatively unknown  set of life style patterns when they reach adulthood. Males reach legal size,  (22&quot;) at an average of five years. All males are sexual mature, (active?), by  three years whereas females take at least another year to reach puberty and  are usually of legal size when they began flaunting their eggs around and  about. Some females grow to 25&quot; by their third year and may grow to 40&quot; by  the time they are ten years old. Males rarely get that big. The largest  recorded California halibut was a big mama measuring 60&quot; and weighing 72 lbs..  So, we can asume that local halibut procreate right here in our bay and their  progeny find their way to protected areas before moving out into the bays.  Juveniles definitely hang here and wind up in the nets San Francisco and San  Pablo Bay shrimpers. When asked where halibut go when they are not in the  Bays, (that is, from late October through Match), Craig, the Sportfishing  Center's owner-operator took an officious stance, &quot;I don&Mac226;t know. Nobody  knows. Probably way out.&quot; <br>
                        <br>
                        More Funny Business It's been a strange year to date. The wind blew so hard this spring that  trips in the Bay had to be cancelled. The ocean was frigid in April and May  and is just now warming up to snuff. A slow salmon bite this spring was  blamed by many on the cold water. But then, why do the same fish go on  feeding frenzies in Alaskan 38o water? Recently there have been some days  where the bite has been almost wide open but then the next day folks have to  scratch to get a salmon a rod. The salmon however, have been as big, as red  and generally as beautiful as anyone can remember.  Halibut fishing in June has been decent some days, spotty on others. The  stripers have moving into San Francisco Bay more slowly than last year but at  this writing, party boats are starting to see limits of stripers taken off  the rockpiles around the bay. Next issue we&Mac226;ll take a look at perceived and real dangers from eating fish  caught in the San Francisco Bay system. Preliminary data from the San  Francisco Estuary Institure indicates that there may be some risk in stuffing  oneself daily with real large bass, paricularly if one does not trim the red  meat from the fillets. Smaller bass, halibut and sturgeon seem to have levels  of mecury and other chemicals in their white fillets that may be of little  concern to most fisherfolk. Weird weather the last two years has had an impact on the fishing. Some good..  Some. . . well, it's a funny business. A final halibut thought: if butts  fought in the water like they do on land our Bay would be awash in human  exotica flown in to hook up with a manhole cover gone amuck.</font></p>

                        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">The last year of the century was a pretty good one for fishers. It will probably be remembered more for the initiation of a meaningful ground fish management policy than for the banner run of really large salmon in April and early May. This aggressive stance on rock fish, (the ten fish limit), flew in the faces of those of us who thought that, just because the Farallon Islands seemed to have plenty of rock fish, management of these species was un-warranted. If the new rules had not been set in place the Islands would have been targeted by the commercial guys as the next wipe-out. So, the draggers and the long liners will have to go elsewhere to make a buck and sport fishers, in concession, (real or implied), will go home with fewer fillets and then none at all in March and April.<br>
                        </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">We can live with that. It will take two or three years to notice the difference but the school fish and ling cod <img height="378" width="213" src="/web/20000817090301im_/http://usafishing.com:80/A-ImagesRockFish/lingcodsantacruz.jpg" align="left">fishery will be a whole lot better five years hence. The ground fish will take longer to make a comeback since their numbers were truly depleted at the Islands and off-shore reefs and these puppies grow a lot more slowly. A chunky eight-pound golden eye rock fish has taken twenty-five to thirty years to get that way! The fish counter at your local supermarket will feature real red snapper, (from the Gulf of Mexico). Local snapper, (rockfish), will be like Orange Roughy or Atlantic Haddock . . . rarely available, and at a price higher than baby sword fish steaks, hand-cut by Linda Greenlaw.<br>
                        Getting back to the wrap-up, last year with a good one for rockfish and ling cod. There were more fish and larger fish at the Farallons and up the Marin Coast. The ling population is definitely on the rise at the Islands and last year saw some spectacular black rockfish jigging and live bait dunking in the shallows up toward Point Reyes. Jaded folks are putting their shrimp flies away in favor of fishing with much lighter gear, (10 to 15 pound line on black bass outfits), with single lures and are finding that they catch larger school fish and have a lot more fun doing it.<br>
                        This year&#146;s crab/rockfish combo trips were a lot more productive this year for two reasons: man and Mother Nature. The commercial guys from Crescent City were not a factor this time around and most of the crowd that catch crab for money, went up North after a month or so of very unspectacular commercial crabbing down here. There was theft, sure: but not the wholesale larceny of last year. This year, drag boats were the main concern and most crab pot losses were due to miscommunication between skippers and draggers.<br>
                        </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">The weather was perfect the first two months of the combo season. Only eight or ten days were missed due to wind and sloppy seas. In January angler interest began to wane and later that month, the weather turned foul and continued that way right through the end of the season. Five trips got out of the harbor in February and though interest picked up the last week of the season, Mother Nature up and squelched it big time. After all was said and done, it was a great season. Anglers got limits of crab every day except for a couple of trips beset by anomalies. Rock fish got pouty in big water but, there were very few days when limits of rock fish were not recorded.<br>
                        Let&#146;s now switch our attention to the glamour fish, the chinook salmon. The season started with a resounding thud; high winds and scattered fish. Within a few days however, a pattern evolved that would pretty much characterize the season . . . not a lot of fish, but what fish these were! Right from the git-go, thirty pound fish pulled surprised anglers four, five, six times around the boat before either breaking off the leader or coming aboar<img height="213" width="213" src="/web/20000817090301im_/http://usafishing.com:80/A-ImagesRockFish/rockfishsantacruz.jpg" align="right">d to taste the milk of human kindness and then interfacing with their good buddies in the box.<br>
                        Taking a step back to look at this state&#146;s state of salmon, one might not be terribly alarmed but should nevertheless, be concerned. The figures that were released several weeks ago by Fish &amp; Game and the Pacific Marine Fisheries Council show that both the fall and spring runs are reasonably healthy. The winter run salmon that were damn near extinct six years ago have rebounded from 110 fish counted then, to more than three thousand fish this year. It would take the counting of 10,000 females to declare this group of fish as recovering. This season&#146;s late start, (April 15), this year is designed to let more of these fish get up the river rather than becoming filets or steaks.<br>
                        A scatter-shot reportage of figures that caught my eye included those showing that in the banner 1995 year, 1.1 fish were caught per angler per trip on party boats and private skiffs. This figure fell to .8 fish in 1998 and then to .6 fish last year. One the other hand, the average fish caught in 1995 weighed a healthy 9.7 pounds at a time when 20&quot; fish were kept all season. In 1998 the fish, partially starved by the consequences of El Nino, averaged 8 pounds, even with a 24&quot; limit most of the season. Last year the fish were scarce most of the season but those caught, averaged more than thirteen pounds each.<br>
                        Incidentally, those fish, hooked in the lips, ran the asses off anglers who had to circle the boat several times to keep up with a fifteen or twenty pound fish. Compare this current salmon sport fishery to the days of catching fish on J hooks, tearing out their esophagus and then reeling them in rather easily as they were bleeding to death and suffocating. All this fun comes as a reward for the simple process of learning not to jerk one&#146;s rod!<br>
                        In the Central Valley, a quarter million fall and spring run fish were counted last year as opposed to 180 thousand the year before. The count on the Feather and American Rivers has seen a four year steady decline while the upper Sacramento looks really good. The San Joaquin system saw just 600 fish several years ago compared to almost nineteen thousand in 1999. The Central Valley count of hatchery fish took a real nose-dive last year after two years of growth. Last year&#146;s 40,000 hatchery fish comprised just 17% of the total run while in 1998, 40% of the run were hatchery spawners. In 1997, 25% of the 279,000 fish in the system were hatchery salmon. What does this mean? I have absolutely no idea but I&#146;m sure a few of you readers can tag these figures as germane to something . . . probably to support whatever theory you might be a proponent of.<br>
                        </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">The most waited for statistic was the 2000 season&#146;s projection of abundance. This projection is the most bantered about in the media and among habitues of tackle shops at this time every year. It really means next to nothing . . . but here we go: It is estimated that 790,000 salmon are swimming up, down and around our coasts; most of them are looking to get laid later this Fall. Meanwhile, they are enjoying masses of bait fish that are moving hither and yon along the fifty fathom curve and points shoreward. Now, last year it was thought that 848,000 salmon were out there and we had only a so-so year.<br>
                        </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">In 1996 they estimated that only 533,000 fish were swimming around our coast but commercial and sport fishermen caught 600,000 of them. Another 275,00 were counted in the Central Valley, leaving one to figure that damned few, if any fish starved, died of illnesses, were gulped by sea lions or taken illegally. Yeah, right! Then in 1998 it was projected that 1,051, 000 fished cruised our shores and only 350,000 were caught and less than 200,000 were counted. Go figure!<br>
                        </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">Halibut are a simpler being. Keep the commercial guys from scooping &#145;em all up as they come in through the Golden Gate and there will be a steady fishery in the Bay and out around the corners. It was an off-year for butts in 1999. They bit fairly well in April and May and then pretty much disappeared. Big halibut came back for a real good anchovy chomp for a couple of weeks around Seal Rocks in July and then made themselves scarce again. Where did they go? Nobody seems to know. After the huge catch four years ago, F&amp;G cut the limit to three and the fishery has settled down to what it probably should be . . . one that ought to be targeted equally or even less than striped bass.<br>
                        </font></p>
                        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">We do know quite a bit about striped bass. The amount fresh water in the spring and early summer is far and away the most important factor in determining what kind of bass season there will be. The last few years has seen less of Northern California&#146;s water shunted south for L.A. lawns; lo and behold, the bass fishing has been far better than the early and mid-nineties. Last summer was a real good one for catching bass. Not the wide-open bite of the water-logged year of 1998, mind you; but good enough to keep people content and fishing during the doldrums when salmon and/or halibut went into a closed-mouth snit of some sort. There was plenty of water last year and along with it, a lot of bait. Striped bass are the most voracious of our sport fishes and when there&#146;s bait, there&#146;s hungry bass.<br>
                        The bass are still on the comeback trail although Emeryville Sportfishing owner Craig Stone, a philosopher of<img height="152" width="164" src="/web/20000817090301im_/http://usafishing.com:80/A-ImagesSTRIPER/capthookstriper.jpg" align="left"> most things fishy, never felt that the numbers were as bad as F&amp;G folks wanted us to believe. In the mid-nineties halibut and salmon were targeted species. The bass catch dwindled, people weren&#146;t willing to fish the rock-piles and the catch plummeted. A lot of bass stayed in the bays this winter and those combined with the return of the spawners later this spring should make for a another good bass year for pot-luck fisher folk.<br>
                        In 1998, El Nino pushed large schools of albacore to within thirty, forty miles of the Golden Gate, resulting in the best tuna fishing in memory. Hot days in August saw 200 or more fish landed on occasions in a few hours by a dozen or so sore-armed fishers. Later in the fall, the albacore got bigger and bigger where it was common to catch several fish over fifty pounds on sorties just beyond the Farallons. Well, that may never happen again but the albacore did return last year and there were several real productive trips by a couple of boats from the Sportfishing Center. Then there were some trips that were near skunkaroos. The faster boats in the harbor will be primed late this Summer, to make a run at some fantastic fishing should the long fins again show up in our neighborhood.<br>
                        There are quite a few changes around the Emeryville Sportfishing Center this year. New boats and skippers are described in the &quot;Crew That Do&quot; column on page two of this screed and there is a greater array of stuff for sale, vying for your consideration, in the shop. New hats, clothing, new fishing gizmos, balms and lotions and of course, a special pail of half-priced condoms and fruit pies.<br>

                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">In a five day marathon of marine biologist s projections, predictions, predilections and resultant fidgety boredom, the advisory committee has suggested nary a change in its recommendation to the National Marine Fisheries Service. This would not prevent that august body however, from dropping a regulatory bomb on the salmon season in mid-April but according to committee member Craig Stone, owner-manager of the Emeryville Sportfishing Center and spoiler of animals, that would be, damn unlikely.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">Craig and New Salmon Queen skipper Kurt Hochburg returned from their annual fun fest in Portland last week bored to tears but feeling like the do-right boys of the deep . So, we will be using the circle hook for mooching and keeping no salmon less than 24 from March 27 to July 1 and from the first of September til season s end on Halloween. During July and August you ll go home with the first two fish you catch regardless of size. The Bay Area fisher's big day of the year is right around the corner and at this writing things look pretty encouraging for the salmon opener. The weather seems to be following a kinder, gentler pattern than El Nino s day-after-day blowouts and there is a lot more bait in a colder, more settled ocean. Nearly every rock fish trip to the Farallons the last few weeks has seen incidental hooking of nice, fat salmon.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">The weather did turn gnarly on the second day of the season for Pigeon Point, South to nether regions. Scores were low but a couple of boats blundered into big bait balls and rewarded those who didn t set their circle hooks with pudgy ten pound fish. The despised circle hook is here to stay as long as the powers that be are concerned with saving the Winter and Spring salmon runs and as long as men will mooch. It seems, that in most cases a salmon will not swallow a circle hook, thus affording itself a much better chance of surviving after being hooked and released.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">The Dept. of Fish &amp; Game has estimated that there are currently about 800,000 adult salmon swimming about in California Coastal waters. This annual projection is somewhat above an average census that is usually underestimated. Last year however, the DFG calculated that more than a million salmon in our neighborhood were looking to get laid but only about half that number were accounted for by the end of the year. The commercial guys caught about 200,000 fish. Sport fishers caught a little over 100,000 and slightly more than 200,000 were counted doing the spawning thing. This means at least a half million salmon starved to death, were eaten by sea lions or successfully hid from folks who would count fish.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">The fall salmon run is what California s commercial and sport fishery is all about. Incidental Winter and Spring runs of smaller salmon, (no more than 20,000 at their peak) became scarce during the eighties due to lumber and agriculture water transgressions. The winter run fish became damn near extinct several years ago. The National Marine Fishery Service decided it incumbent to save these rag-tag, pint sized cousins from being finished off by sea lions. They have spent mucho millions of dollars ditzing around Shasta Dam to insure correct Spring spawning temperatures and instituted the spate of salmon fishing regulations that we fish by today.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">From an estimated low of one hundred and fifty fish in 1995, the winter run has reportedly increased to well over a thousand at this juncture. This run will be restored when and if it reaches the 10,000 level. It should be pointed out that looking for these small winter run fish frolicking in five feet of muddy water yields a somewhat less accurate count than that of their big bouncy cousins that squirrel around in the Autumn shallows. Since a majority of the Winter and Spring run salmon are less than 24 inches long the current length limit gives these fish a better chance to survive so they can be not counted while propagating later on. The preservation of these fish is the reason the salmon season openers have been moved from mid February to the end of March. In July and August the threatened cousins allegedly refrain from cruising our coast. Why then can t we mooch with J-hooks and jerk our rods in a manly fashion during July and August. Who knows? -Kim Gale</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">THE CREW THAT DO Happier days here in harmony harbor. Weather has been allowing trips two, three, even four days a week and the salmon opener is right around the corner. Inspections have been passed, hulls cleaned, blotches painted over. Were ready to go. As for any kind of set schedule based on prognosis, there s not! The skippers, the deckhands, the folks behind the counter, i.e.: the crew that do will take advantage of weather, whereabouts of fish and their proclivity toward giving it up and of course, the whims of their clients: to explore and exploit any option.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">March 27th will find everyone mooching for salmon. The C-Gull II with captains Don Wong and Jay Yokomizo and Becka the blond bombshell in the wheel house will continue fishing for salmon into April as will captain Harry Garabedian s New Seeker with Ralph at the controls. Both boats will be available to do rockfish and crab combo trips on demand.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">Look for skipper Kurt Hochberg on the New Salmon Queen to mooch for salmon until something better happens. Former roller derby ace and skipper emeritus Art Roby starts fishing for salmon aboard his New Huck Finn but will begin patrolling the Bays for halibut and striped bass with live bait somewhere around the middle of April. Fish ho Mick Menigoz will watch whales on weekends but will fish for anything that bites during the week while skippering his big, fast Super Fish. The very well rounded captain Ivan Hotz becomes a regular pillar of the Emeryville Sportfishing Center skipper s fraternity on the rapid Rapid Transit. Chris Smith will putt-put down from Crockett at the helm of the Captain Hook in mid-April to join the fishing for butts n bass. A bit later in April Barry Caranavo brings his six-pack, Fishing Fool IV to grace the harbor. Barry will fish for anything you want and will get you there in a real hurry. -K.G.</font></p>

                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">At a recent week-long meeting of the Pacific Fishery Management Council in Sacramento, folks weighed options to save an allegedly endangered ling cod fishery. Unfortunately it seems that the council has lumped the entire Pacific Coast together when considering this one fishery. Ling cod have been rare in Southern California since Hector was a pup and recently, the ling population along the coasts of Oregon and Washington have been ravaged by commercial enterprises determined to market anything that swims. The ling cod of Central and Northern California are, by and large, thriving. Party boats and skiffs targeting lings have seen no decline in recent years. The main depredations have come from the commercial</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">guys who are not working with any size restrictions. The ling cod fishing at Cordell Banks and the Farallon Islands seems to be better now than it has in many years and should continue to improve with the new size and quantity restrictions in place since the first of the year.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">The most severe of the options being considered for passage by the council at the next meeting in early November is a total ban on the taking of ling cod: anywhere, any time. Other options include a seven month season, limited size windows, (i.e.: 24&quot; to 34&quot; only) or one-a-day limits.</font></p>
                    <p><font face="Comic Sans MS,Arial Black">In order to avoid an unwarranted end to fishing for ling cod it is essential that you, the fisher folk, make your views known to the Council before the first of November. Facts and figures are the fodder these folks feed on, so talk to your local sport fishing professionals, check out the &quot;Fishing USA&quot; web site on the net and then write, fax, call and or email: The Pacific Fishery Management Council, 2130 SW 5th Avenue, Suite 224 in Portland, OR 97201. The phone Number is (503) 326-6352 while the fax number is (503) 326-6831. For the computer enhanced, their email is www.pcouncil.org.DO IT! -K.G.</font>
