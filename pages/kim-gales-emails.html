<h4>Letters To Editor</h4>
<p>In the 1990s a lot more sites had "reader comments" type sections, where the "webmaster" or content editor would post emails they'd recieved, with responses. The format of websites back then was more heavily influeced by magazines, which always have a "letters to the editor" part. Also, running a forum (or bbs? bulletin board?) was a lot more complicated 20 years ago than it is nowadays.</p>
<p>Of course, Gramps was up in those "reader comments" sections. Fishing reports from two decades ago probably aren't the most riveting read, but maybe if you knew Kim around that time you were involved in some of the things he mentions. This particular thread is an exchange with Ken Jones, of <a href="pierfishing.com">Pierfishing.com</a> fame.  </p>

<p>Hi Ken:</p>
<p>I just stumbled upon your website while poking around trying to find some info on California halibut. I've perked right up at the sight of  your site in that I do a lot of pier fishing in the Bay Area. I write  a newsletter for the Emeryville Sportfishing Center and a column on  FishingUSA called Kim Gale's Fishtales. Are you still doing this site? Most of the reports seem to be more  than a year old. If you have plans to revive this site and can use a bit of help, give me a holler. I'm semi-retired, poor as a church  mouse but still manage to fish two or three days a week. Would offer  to buy your book but I'm saving every damn penny for a trip to Florida  the end of the month where I'll be spending a day fishing for snook  from a flat boat and then a day trolling for king mackerel. In any event I look forward to hearing from you and will try to buy  your book in May and will in the meantime add your site to my  bookmarks.</p>
<p>Caio, Kim Gale</p>
<p><em>Hi Kim,
I'm a little confused on your note. The Pier Fishing in California site (pierfishing.com) is updated monthly. It has a new Report Page added on the first of each month together with a new Pier of the Month, Fish of the Month, Fish Pictures Page and Comments Pages. It also now has a Message Board Page for up to the minute information. It does have old reports but they are in the archived section. I'm not sure why most of what you saw was old information.<br/>
I'm always looking for reports on how anglers are doing and still need reporters for many piers -- including those in Oakland and Emeryville. So, if you have any reports please send them in. I'll also try to check out your column on the FishingUSA site.</em></p>
<p><em>Hope you have some good fishing down in Florida! I've only been there once, and was only able to do a little freshwater bass fishing, but it's an area that I've often wanted to visit. Let me know how you do and be sure to keep in touch.</em></p>
<p><em>Best wishes, Ken Jones, The Pier Fisherman</em></p>

<p>Good morning Ken:  </p>
<p>Spent the last hour nosing around your site. I like it! Unfortunately  I can't get anything you've published after February 1998, and my  server will not find URLs for The Pier of the Month or Fish of the  Month. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that I am using Netscape 2.0. By  late June I will be replacing my clunky old Mac Performa 450 with a  new or nearly new 'pewter" that should drag me into the latter part of  this decade. I'm planning on spending tomorrow, (Tuesday) morning on the Berkeley  Pier fishing for butt. A few flatties have reportedly bit frozen  anchovies in the last couple of weeks but a stop at Keith Frasier's bait bin in San Rafael for a few shiner perch may make my day. I'll talk to folks on the pier and the Berkeley Marina Shop and write  up a dollop of a report to you. Am presuming you would rather not get e-mail attachments so will just  send this to you as straight e-mail.  </p>
<p>Caio,  Kim Gale  </p>
<p><em>Kim,<br/>
Thanks for the information -- and I'm going to ask my webmaster to try to figure out why you can't find the pages.<br/>
I'll look forward to the reports.<br/>
Best wishes, Ken</em></p>

<p>Good morning Ken:  </p>
<p>Tried to leave this for you yesterday but had to leave the house at  3:30 for a long day of salmon fishing.  Hope you can use this. Would a detailed primer on Berkeley pier halibut catching techniques and gear be of interest? A note: the USA fishing "hotsheet" claims that four halibut were caught on the pier yesterday.  </p>
<p>Caio, Kim Gale  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tuesday looked like the day for the first halibut of the year at the  Berkeley Pier. Just a bit of a cool breeze from the South at seven  o'clock and leaden skies as I stopped half way out to the end to offer my crab net to a couple of young men trying to coax a twenty inch  striper into a bucket under the pier. Mission accomplished to profound  thanks and so, to the end of the pier to hang anchovies under a  couple of bobbers while I dropped a bit of pile worm on a no. 8 hook  for shiner perch. High tide in three hours, at which point the water  should clear up a bit. There was currently about a foot of visibility.  Not too good.  The sky brightened and the first shiner perch came aboard to get a  nice two-aught bait hook in its nose. Measured the water depth again.  Twelve feet deep. So the squirrely little Ms. Halibut Food swam eleven  and a half feet under the bobber to mosey about the bottom offering herself to big bad Mr. Butt. Just before the tide changed I caught three more little perch about thirty to fifty feet north of the pier. Funny thing; up until last year most shiner perch would be caught right under the pier or more  often than naught, between five to ten feet out from the South side. Last year the little buggers changed their modus. A nice Korean gentleman who had been fishing cut anchovies began pulling in some really pretty one to two pound kingfish. He was  explaining the vagaries of cooking the ubiquitous croaker when I  noticed that my little "shiner perch pole" was bent nearly double and  in the process of going over the side. A five minute tussle ensued,  garnering oohs and ahs from a gaggle of German tourists, before a  leopard shark, probably about thirty inches, surfaced to show his  handsome face before doing a back flip with a double twist to snap off  the four pound leader. Completely unconvinced to cast anchovy chunks and maybe start liking  kingfish, I squinted even harder at the two bobbers on an almost flat bay. It was one o'clock when the breeze began to freshen from the West  and I entrusted my rods to the care of my croaker loving accomplice  and strolled down the pier to question the four or five other souls who seemed to be targeting halibut. Not so much as a tale of a nibble  from any of them. Everyone concurred that there had been a few butts  caught in the last couple of weeks, but that today, glorious sunshine  notwithstanding, was not the day. By two the wind was really starting to howl as I broke camp for the  mile-long walk off the pier. No sign of a halibut this day but quite a  few shiner perch around. A few folks had caught kingfish, small  flounder and a couple of big barred perch. I saw one jacksmelt 
chasing my worm retrieve but only one person was fishing for them and  his face was as forlorn as his bucket was empty. I stopped in at the Berkeley Marina bait shop and chatted for a bit with manager Bob Nakaji who said that indeed, a few butts had been  bagged on the pier but the real action was just waiting to break. "Any  day now".</p>

<p><em>Hi Kim,
Thanks for the report and it will be added to the message board as soon as I finish this note.<br/>
Sounds like things are just starting to pick up; by June the flatties should be in full swing.<br/>
Best of luck, Ken</em></p>

<p>Hi Ken:</p>
<p>Found 'yer site. Looks good!  Will explore it more as time allows. Plan to do one more stint on the Berkeley pier before going to  Florida. Are you interested in shore fishing reports? For instance: yesterday two keeper sturgeon were hauled up on the rip rap behind the Oceans East restaurant across the street from the Emeryville Sportfishing  Center. There were eight or ten folks fishing the top of the tide with  pile worms when the fun began.</p>
<p>Caio,  Kim Gale</p>
<p><em>Hi Kim,
I'm not really interested in shore reports although when you hear something interesting by all means include it; many pier fishermen also fish from the shore occasionally.<br/>
Best of luck at both Berkeley and Florida,<br/>
Ken</em></p>

Subject: sturgeon hot bite  </p>
<p>Hi Ken:  </p>
<p>Ten keeper sturgeon were caught today in a fifty foot frontage area behind the Hong Kong Ocean East restaurant which is across the street  from the Emeryville Sportfishing Center. Three keepers were hauled away on Friday. These fish are being nailed on the incoming tide. There is a lot of herring spawn on rocks at this location. I would like to report that the fish are dying on the restaurant's, "to die for", translucent shrimp dumplings dipped in pile worm juice but that's just not true. Pile worms alone are doing the trick. Will be doing the Berkeley Pier for halibut tomorrow.</p>
<p>Regards, Kim Gale</p>

<p>Hi Ken;  </p>
<p>Herewith a report you might choose to use  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a rosy fingered dawn and I caught my first shiner perch on the  way out to the end of the Berkeley pier. The party boats putt-putted  on toward the Gate as  I reeled in  the second and last bait fish I  would need this day. While feisty little perch with hooks through  their noses swam around under bouncing bobbers, efforts to get relief  help were hammered by leopard sharks and sting rays who seemed to  delight in running off with worm bits and then breaking the hooks or  leaders when I had the audacity to put the graphite to 'em.  About seven-thirty I was finally had company at that end of the pier  by three guys from Richmond toting a jury-made five gallon bucket  filled with a quarter scoop of anchovies "How long do you think those will live?" I almost smirked. "I duuno", replied Dino Cuccia, "but it  sure beats trying to catch those damn shiner perch. Ten minutes later  Dino's rod tip went straight toward Tibet, and it wasn't long before a 29-inch, ten-pound striped bass was experiencing labored breathing on  the cement.  Turned out most of the anchovies were still living at one o'clock when  I left. A bit later at the Berkeley Marina Bait Shop I asked Brian Collier about the amazing endurance of his anchovies. "It's the potato chips," said Brian. "What?" "Yeah, old chips, bread crumbs, whatever.  We grind it up and feed our chovies every other day. They stay  slippery and slimy. You can bounce 'em off the deck and they won't  shed a scale. Most of them can bang their noses bloody against the  inside of a bucket and still live for hours."  I digress. Back to this morning at the pier. The Cuccia party began getting their  rods bent one right after the other, but nary a bass or butt. They  were in the 'ray hole'. About every ten minutes someone fishing from  the North side of the second half of the pier was running toward Berkeley trying to curb their sting ray. Some of these beasties were pretty big, ten to twenty pounds and a lot of folks lost gear under  the pier. About noon the shiner perch went blitzoid on the South side toward the  top of the tide, but the halibut and bass stayed away. There had been  one to four per day butts caught last week. Butt not today.</p>
